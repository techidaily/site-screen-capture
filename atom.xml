Even when the visual part is top-notch, if the audio part such as background music and the voice narration is not good enough, you lose interest in the video. Therefore, you have to pay equal attention to the video recording as well as voiceover recording. A voiceover is basically a person speaking in the background as the video is playing along to make proper sense as well as to add more context to the video.</p><p>A voiceover recording can be describing the video, explaining concepts, highlighting important points, and likewise. Generally, a voiceover is added to the video after the video is already recorded. In order to record a good voice over, there are certain essential elements you need to have beforehand. In this article, we will explain why and how to record a voice over and how to make a voice over good to get everyone’s attention and appreciation.</p><h2 id="1-Why-To-Record-A-Voiceover"><a href="#1-Why-To-Record-A-Voiceover" class="headerlink" title="1. Why To Record A Voiceover?"></a>1. Why To Record A Voiceover?</h2><p>The engagement on a video depends both on how good the video content as well as how good the audio is. The audio in a video is not just about background music. A good voiceover can do wonders in terms of retaining the attention of the viewers as well as showcasing your personality traits.</p><p>A voice over recording is a must when you are making instructional, educational, and informational videos. Imagine watching a tutorial video where there is no voice to explain what is happening on the screen, everyone will leave the video immediately. Therefore, a voiceover essentially explains the video so that everyone can understand and even relate properly.</p><h2 id="2-Essential-elements-for-a-good-voice-over"><a href="#2-Essential-elements-for-a-good-voice-over" class="headerlink" title="2. Essential elements for a good voice over"></a>2. Essential elements for a good voice over</h2><p>You have to ensure that your voice over recording is great from all perspectives. There are certain essential elements that you have to get right in order to make a voice over mediocre to good and even great.</p><p><strong>Audio Clarity</strong></p><p>Every great voiceover has perfect voice quality and comfortable volume. Audiences may find it distracting if the voiceover recording has a muddy and muffled sound. They will definitely miss the important message that you may want to share through the video. Low volume will make people difficult to hear whereas too loud can cause irritation.</p><p>To ensure audio clarity, professionals use voice over recording studio. If you generally record voice over at home, make sure you do it when there is absolute silence in the background. Besides, the mic quality should be top-notch to pick your voice only as close to original and eliminate background noise.</p><p><strong>Pacing of Pitch</strong></p><p>Pacing is the speed of how fast or slow your pitch is. If you go too fast, your audience will not be able to catch you. On the contrary, the slow pace can be boring. It is important to have a natural pace for everyone to understand as well as stay interested. Therefore, maintain a good pace throughout the video but take pauses to add audio effects. Pauses are a part of pacing for allowing the listeners to grab information and for you to breathe properly so that mic does not catch it.</p><p><strong>Vocal Tone</strong></p><p>Vocal tone is about speaking in a pleasant, soothing but natural manner. You need to make sure that the tone has to be engaging but friendly. Sometimes, you may have to fake it but it must not sound fake or boring for the listeners. A proper vocal tone comes with regular practice and experimentation.</p><p><strong>Pronunciation</strong></p><p>Always make sure that you pronounce every word correctly. The listeners must clearly understand what you speak clearly. Avoid mumbling, over-enunciating, and shouting. At times, you may have to avoid your regional accent to make the audience understand with more clarity. Always ask feedback from listeners to be better at pronouncing certain words.</p><h2 id="3-How-To-Record-A-Voice-Over"><a href="#3-How-To-Record-A-Voice-Over" class="headerlink" title="3. How To Record A Voice Over?"></a>3. How To Record A Voice Over?</h2><p>Here are the steps to follow to record voiceover properly like professionals.</p><p><strong>Getting Ready</strong></p><ul><li>Location: Look for a quiet place to work. Professional voice artists opt for a soundproof room to cancel out external noise. However, you can even go for a quiet area where there is no distracting noise. Microphones can pick up ambient noise that will be reflected in the voiceover recording. Apart from human conversations, you will also have to be careful of the sound coming from electronic gadgets such as computer fans.</li><li>Microphone: Look for a top-notch microphone as per your budget. Consider using a pop filter if you are going to use an external mic. It helps to reduce the distracting sounds with certain alphabets as well as the sound of breathing. Among affordable microphones, you may use modern earbuds or headphones with mic that you use for your smartphone. There are many USB microphones available in the market at an affordable value.</li><li>Voiceover Recorder Software: You need a good-quality audio recording software to record voiceover as well as edit the recording as per requirement. There are many free as well as premium audio recording software available in the market today. We recommend Wondershare Filmora as you can record voice over for any video like professionals as well as edit the recording of audio and video in the same software.</li></ul><p><strong>Writing A Proper Script</strong></p><p>The best way to sound professional during a voice over is to use a proper script. When you don’t use a script, then there can be a lot of pauses and you may try to think about what you will have to say next. When you use a script, you have everything planned out beforehand. Besides, you can also practice what to say when you have a script with pointers and even full explanation of each point. Try to read the script many times and be careful of the words and phrases that can be awkward. Adjust the script accordingly so that it will fit perfectly in the recording.</p><p><strong>Performing A Test Recording</strong></p><p>It is always advisable to go for a test recording to ensure that everything is working properly. In a test recording, you don’t have to go for the entire script but just a few paragraphs. Check if the audio is clear, the volume is at the right level, and the recording is seamless. Check the audio quality by using headphones and not computer speakers.</p><p>**<strong>Microphone Placement</strong> - If you keep the microphone too close to the mouth, there will be all kinds of weird sounds including air puffs. Too far placement will make your voice get fainted. The perfect placement should be about 6 to 8 inches from the mouth and it has to be slightly below the chin.

You can edit the recorded video and make it more interesting to get positive feedback from online viewers.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/lightninglash-delaytape-playback/"><u>LightningLash DelayTape Playback</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-from-still-shots-to-moving-images-ipads-timelapse-magic-for-2024/"><u>[New] From Still Shots to Moving Images  IPad's Timelapse Magic for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-no-fuss-strategies-recording-your-google-voice-calls/"><u>[Updated] No-Fuss Strategies  Recording Your Google Voice Calls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-essential-video-capture-tools-for-windows-10-users-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Essential Video Capture Tools for Windows 10 Users for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-facecam-mastery-strategies-for-outstanding-video-quality/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Facecam Mastery  Strategies for Outstanding Video Quality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-zoom-strategies-engaging-small-groups-efficiently/"><u>[Updated] Zoom Strategies  Engaging Small Groups Efficiently</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-essential-strategies-for-high-quality-youtube-recording/"><u>[New] Essential Strategies for High-Quality YouTube Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-ultimate-guide-to-the-top-webcams-for-windows-10/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  The Ultimate Guide to the Top Webcams for Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-vdv-hd-screen-grabber-review-the-ultimate-guide/"><u>[New] VDV HD Screen Grabber Review  The Ultimate Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-affordable-facetime-replacements-for-android/"><u>[New] Affordable FaceTime Replacements for Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-preeminent-5-photo-background-changer-tools-iphone-x87-edition/"><u>[Updated] Preeminent 5 Photo Background Changer Tools  IPhone X/8/7 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-maximizing-collaboration-zoom-session-setup-and-management/"><u>In 2024, Maximizing Collaboration  Zoom Session Setup and Management</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/finding-high-quality-wolf-howl-noises-for-projects/"><u>Finding High-Quality Wolf Howl Noises for Projects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-unlock-screen-saving-potential-on-android-devices-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unlock Screen Saving Potential on Android Devices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-your-boost-mobile-iphone-12-pro-max-before-the-plan-expires-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Unlock Your Boost Mobile iPhone 12 Pro Max Before the Plan Expires</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-building-your-brand-making-money-with-vids/"><u>[New] Building Your Brand  Making Money with Vids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-prime-open-source-tools-for-educational-screenshots/"><u>[New] Prime Open-Source Tools for Educational Screenshots</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-cut-to-the-chase-newest-method-for-idevice-screen-recordings-2023-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Cut-to-the-Chase  Newest Method for iDevice Screen Recordings, 2023 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/your-account-has-been-disabled-in-the-app-store-and-itunes-on-apple-iphone-13-mini-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Your Account Has Been Disabled in the App Store and iTunes On Apple iPhone 13 mini?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/iphone-is-disabled-here-is-the-way-to-unlock-disabled-apple-iphone-13-by-drfone-ios/"><u>iPhone Is Disabled?

The new iPhone 7 comes with an array of new next-gen technology that is sure to leave you breathless. There is no headphone jack, the phone feature new and improved display, the iPhone 7 plus has rear dual cameras that Apple says is a game changer. The phone is waterproof, and it also comes with a new chic design with a variety of colors to choose from such as ‘Jet Black’.</p><p> Bloggers and Vloggers have a reason to smile with the release of the new iPhone 7. Making tutorials is now easier with the new iPhone. There are several ways to go about. You can either use Quicktime on Mac, Reflector on PC or a third party app called AirShou. All of these methods are great, but you want to find the technique that best fits your purposes.</p><h2 id="How-to-record-the-screen-of-iPhone-7-7-Plus"><a href="#How-to-record-the-screen-of-iPhone-7-7-Plus" class="headerlink" title="How to record the screen of iPhone 7&#x2F;7 Plus"></a>How to record the screen of iPhone 7&#x2F;7 Plus</h2><p><strong>Update:</strong> Now with iOS 11, you can just record the screen with its built-in tool, check this video to know how-to steps:</p><h4 id="Method-1-Using-Quicktime-on-Mac"><a href="#Method-1-Using-Quicktime-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Method 1 Using Quicktime on Mac"></a>Method 1 Using Quicktime on Mac</h4><p> On the new iPhone 7, recording your screen with Quicktime will require you to have two things.</p><ul><li>a) Mac with OS X (Yosemite) or later</li><li>b) Lightning Port and iOS 8 or later</li></ul><p> <strong>How to Record iPhone 7 Screen Using Quicktime on Mac</strong></p><ul><li>1. First, you need to connect the iPhone 7 to your Mac using the lightning cable.</li><li>2. Once the connection is detected, start the Quicktime software on your Mac.</li><li>3. Look for the File option and select ‘Record a Movie.’</li><li>4. Look for the record button and select the dropdown arrow to show more options.</li><li>5. There, you will find the option to record the screen of your iPhone 7. Immediately you select this option, you will notice that your iPhone’s screen is duplicated on your Mac.</li><li>6. If you only want to record the screen without any voice over sound, then click the ‘None’ option as your microphone. If you want to track your on-screen clicks, then select the ‘Show Mouse Clicks’ option.</li><li>7. Use the volume slider to monitor the recording’s audio.</li><li>8. If you want to record a certain portion of your screen, simply drag the area you want to record and then tap the recording button within that area to start recording, otherwise, if it’s the whole screen, simply tap anywhere on the screen to start recording.</li></ul><p> Check this video to see detailed steps</p><h4 id="Method-2-Using-Reflector-on-PC"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Reflector-on-PC" class="headerlink" title="Method 2 Using Reflector on PC"></a>Method 2 Using Reflector on PC</h4><p> Using Reflector is probably the easiest and most convenient way to record your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 plus screen. Since it’s a third-party app, you will need to first download it to your computer, then simply install it on you Mac, Windows PC or Chrome Book. For Reflector to work on your iPhone, you need to have installed Airplay on your device. Reflector works the same way Quicktime does, by mirroring your iPhone 7 screen on the computer’s screen.</p><p> Launch Reflector on your computer then launch Airplay on your device and then ensure that ‘Mirroring’ option is turned on. Once your iPhone detects your computer, connect to it and then simply record your IPhone screen with your computer.</p><p> Check this video to see detailed steps</p><p> The beauty about this method is that one, it caters for everyone, unlike using Quicktime which is only for Mac users and two, it does not need any cables or adapters since it is wireless.</p><h4 id="Method-3-Using-the-AirShou-App"><a href="#Method-3-Using-the-AirShou-App" class="headerlink" title="Method 3 Using the AirShou App"></a>Method 3 Using the AirShou App</h4><ul><li>a) Download AirShou directly on your iPhone 7. Users with iOS 9.3 or higher are required to set back their dates to 2012 for the apps to install without issues.</li><li>b) You will get a popup telling you that the app isn’t trusted, but go ahead to your settings and allow this program to be installed.</li><li>c) Before you start recording, make sure ‘mirroring’ in airplay is on and your device is selected.</li><li>d) Simply launch the AirShou app and then create a free account and then start recording.</li></ul><p> Check this video to see detailed steps</p><p> This app requires no jailbreaking and will work on iOS 7 and 8 as well as iOS 9 or higher.</p><h2 id="How-to-edit-your-recorded-videos"><a href="#How-to-edit-your-recorded-videos" class="headerlink" title="How to edit your recorded videos"></a>How to edit your recorded videos</h2><p> Video Editing with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> WondershareFilmora has been proven effective in editing recorded videos in iPhone 7 and previous versions.</p><ul><li>a) It supports a bunch of video formats such as .mp4, .avi, .mov, .avchd and lots more.</li><li>b) It enables you to trim, crop, combine, and split and cut your video(s).</li><li>c) It has an amazing filter gallery and awesome effects.</li><li>d) You can save the edited video in any format you choose, and enough to fit in your phone.</li><li>e) Edited videos are burnable on DVD, and can be uploaded on the internet.</li></ul><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> Now you have an idea of how to record your iPhone 7 screen with all these amazing methods.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Exacting-Speech-Recognition-via-Google’s-Precision-Tools"><a href="#Exacting-Speech-Recognition-via-Google’s-Precision-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Exacting Speech Recognition via Google’s Precision Tools"></a>Exacting Speech Recognition via Google’s Precision Tools</h2><p>Speech to text service is becoming mainstream with each passing day. In addition, developers are continually innovating their programs to make your document processing easier. For example, you can now use google translate voice to text when you are typing a document for a diverse audience.</p><p>Below is a full guide on how to translate speech to text the right way with Google Translate. In addition, you will discover alternatives to google speech translate, including their summary and how they compare to one another.</p><h2 id="Part1-How-to-translate-speech-to-text-with-Google-Translate"><a href="#Part1-How-to-translate-speech-to-text-with-Google-Translate" class="headerlink" title="Part1: How to translate speech to text with Google Translate?"></a>Part1: How to translate speech to text with Google Translate?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/google-speech-translate-1.jpg"                      alt="translate speech"                ></p><p>Google Translate is one of the easiest voice typing apps to use. However, before you go through the steps on how to use Google speech translate, here are a few points you need to consider:</p><ul><li>You need to have an external microphone to use google speech translate. Laptop and notebook owners can rely on their in-built microphone, and desktop users will need an external one. In addition, using a headset has better results than an external microphone.</li><li>Ensure you allow google translate voice to text to access your device’s microphone. You will find your microphone settings in the <strong>Control Panel</strong> for Windows and <strong>Preferences</strong> if you are a Mac user.</li><li>Unfortunately, you cannot upload audio files to Google speech translate. In addition, there is no information if subsequent updates of the app will include the feature.</li><li>Regarding Google speech to text pricing, the app is free to download and use. Although the service is available from the web browser, having an active Google account enables you to access its full features.</li><li>Although Google translate voice to text can detect your language, it does suffer accuracy issues occasionally. Therefore, confirm that you select the correct language before using the translation service.</li></ul><p>The above points apply to all versions of Google speech translate, whether on your smartphone, tablet, or computer. Now that you are aware of the app’s key user points, here is how you can translate speech to text with Google Translate:</p><p>1. Launch the app from your device’s home screen or the installation directory for computer users.</p><p>2. Select the languages you want to translate from the main screen using the arrow buttons on the bottom right corner of each box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/google-speech-translate-2.jpg"                      alt="arrow buttons"                ></p><p>For example, if you want to translate English to French, English will appear in the first box and French in the other. Kindly note that the app does not detect microphone input automatically. The feature is only available for typed text.</p><p>3. Proceed to the bottom of the page and click the Microphone button to begin translating your speech to text input. Ensure you are in a quiet environment for best results.</p><p>4. You can end your recording by clicking the Stop button.</p><p>5. You can listen to your translation by clicking the Listen button from the right box of Google speech translate. In addition, you can switch between playback speeds by pressing the Listen button repeatedly.</p><h2 id="Part2-How-to-translate-recorded-speeches-with-Google-Translate"><a href="#Part2-How-to-translate-recorded-speeches-with-Google-Translate" class="headerlink" title="Part2: How to translate recorded speeches with Google Translate?"></a>Part2: How to translate recorded speeches with Google Translate?</h2><p>Unfortunately, Google Translate does not support the translation of audio file uploads, such as recorded speeches and music files. The service only supports translation of the following file types;</p><ul><li>Docx</li><li>Pdf</li><li>Pptx</li><li>Xlsx</li></ul><p>It also allows you to translate websites in your browser automatically. Here is how to translate websites with Google Translate:</p><ol><li>Click on the Websites tab from the app’s home page.</li><li>Select the original language as Detect Language because the app refers to its over 100-language library to determine the source language. Inputting the wrong source language will result in an incorrect translation.</li><li>Type the URL you need to translate in the Website textbox and click Go to view the website in your preferred language.</li></ol><p>So, how can you translate recorded audio using Google Translate?

As such, you need to transcribe the recorded speech using a different transcription app, then upload the transcript to Google Translate. The compatible file formats are .docx, .pdf, .pptx, and .xlsx.</p><p>Some of the transcribing apps you can use include, Trint, Rev, and Happy Scribe. In addition, check if the apps require you to purchase a subscription before using them. Although some apps offer free trials, your access may have feature limitations. For example, most apps limit transcription of recorded audio files to between five and sixty minutes, depending on the developer.</p><h3 id="Paste-to-Google-translate"><a href="#Paste-to-Google-translate" class="headerlink" title="Paste to Google translate"></a>Paste to Google translate</h3><p>Once you finish transcribing the speech recording from the third-party app, ensure you save it in the file formats indicated above. You will then follow the below steps to finish translating your speech recording.</p><ol><li>Launch Google Translate on your device.</li><li>Tap the Documents tab from the app’s home screen.</li><li>Select the Detect Language option for the left box, and choose your desired translation language for the right box. Typically, the app lists English, Spanish, and Arabic as the default language options. However, you will find additional languages by clicking the down arrow on the right. Google Translate has over 100 languages in its internal library, including Xhosa and Latin. Despite this, you should always check the translation accuracy before submitting your work. This is because the app can sometimes ignore the translation language’s grammar and punctuation rules.</li></ol><h3 id="What’s-the-Best-Alternative-to-Google-STT-Translation"><a href="#What’s-the-Best-Alternative-to-Google-STT-Translation" class="headerlink" title="What’s the Best Alternative to Google STT Translation?"></a>What’s the Best Alternative to Google STT Translation?</h3><p>Google translate voice to text is among the top voice typing apps in the market.

With a single hit of the vein of bricks, the entire chunk of the similar brick will vanish. It seems like cheating but as you know Terraria is all about clicking and clicking is king. So it will save you a lot of time and effort of clicking each brick of the Terraria.</p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li>Mine in the Terraria more easily</li><li>Destroy the entire chunk of blocks in one click</li><li>Save your time and clicks</li></ul><h4 id="9-Fargo’s-Mutant-Mod"><a href="#9-Fargo’s-Mutant-Mod" class="headerlink" title="9.

This will make it hard for you to have in mind what you have accomplished and what you have to accomplish next. This Boss Checklist mod will be beneficial in that case. It will provide you with an in-game list of all the bosses and activities you have achieved and have to achieve. It almost supports all kinds of mods which makes it one of the best Terraria mods. However, if you have added a small mod, it might not support Boss Checklist because it depends upon the permission provided by each mod to Boss Checklist to access the progress.</p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li>Keep record of everything you do</li><li>Check what you have accomplished</li><li>Check what you have to accomplish</li><li>Keep record of every boss you kill</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="Filmora-Best-Game-Video-Recorder-and-Editor"><a href="#Filmora-Best-Game-Video-Recorder-and-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Filmora - Best Game Video Recorder and Editor"></a>Filmora - Best Game Video Recorder and Editor</h3><ul><li>Record game videos on your computer with audio and webcam.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> quickly with a wide range of gaming effects.</li><li>Rich video tempaltes and resources for game videos.</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion:"></a><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h4><p>It is fun to play Terraria but the fun and thrill will be doubled by adding the above mods.

The process is very simple. All you need to do is follow the same steps indicated above. Once you get to the “Change Background” option or “Effects” option click on that and then press the “Add” icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-image-as-google-meet-video-background.jpg"                      alt="add image as Google Meet background"                ></p><p>After doing that, a pop of your images will automatically appear on your screen from which you can select the image you would like to upload on Google Meet and use.

On the split side, if you are an iOS user then opt for an iPhone 8 or latest version, an iPad 5th Generation or later, or any Apple device which has iOS 12 or above.</p><p>Tip: In some cases you might get cropped out due to your background, to avoid that, you will need to turn it off. Also, if your device has a low battery, you might want to turn your background off, to make your battery last longer.</p><p>Just as you are allowed to change your background on Google Meet on desktop, similarly you can change it on a mobile device. The process is fairly simple too. The steps outlined below are for Android as well as iOS.</p><ol><li>Open the Google Meet application on your device. Before joining the meeting on your device click the “Effects” icon, you will find it near the bottom of your screen on self-view. With effects, you can alter the lighting during your call to create a more clear ambiance.</li><li>Don’t want to let your colleagues to where you are at and remain professional at the same time? Google Meet has got you covered! You can blur the background now! To use the pre-built backgrounds, tap the background you would like to use from the given options. There are numerous options ranging from professional workspaces to a beachside view!</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-video-background-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="change Google Meet background"                ></p><ol><li>To upload a background of your own choice, tap the “Add” button and you can add a completely new background!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Conquering-Live-Broadcast-A-Comprehensive-Guide-for-YouTube-Twitch"><a href="#Conquering-Live-Broadcast-A-Comprehensive-Guide-for-YouTube-Twitch" class="headerlink" title="Conquering Live Broadcast: A Comprehensive Guide for YouTube &amp; Twitch"></a>Conquering Live Broadcast: A Comprehensive Guide for YouTube &amp; Twitch</h2><h2 id="Part-1-Introduction"><a href="#Part-1-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Introduction"></a>Part 1: Introduction</h2><p>If you want to enhance your audience reach, consider multi-streaming to Twitch and your other preferred sites. Mainstreaming enables you to broadcast on Twitch and YouTube or stream on Twitch and Facebook, or all three! At the same time, with everyone spending more time indoors amid the global crisis, it appears we’re all seeking a diversion and many gamers are asking themselves how to broadcast on YouTube or Twitch. One of the easiest methods to broadcast on Twitch and YouTube Gaming at the same time is via OBS. Streamers may broadcast to more than 30 streaming platforms concurrently using an easy-to-understand user interface. The service is created in a manner that won’t place any demand on your PC hardware or the bandwidth you have available.</p><p>Well, it all boils down to choosing. But if you want to know the streaming networks with the highest traffic, those platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming. Twitch is a mainstreaming service that enables you to broadcast on more than 30 of your favorite platforms simultaneously. It merely takes a few minutes to join your numerous live streaming accounts and interact directly with the popular encoding program OBS. You may also multi streams on Twitch and your other favorite streaming services. Knowing what the correct gear is when you’re starting as a streamer may be intimidating, but we come with good news. Nowadays the entry-level for streaming has reduced quite a bit owing to hardware becoming more affordable, but also because many PCs are already prepared to manage a broadcast or can be readily updated to support one.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Stream-to-Twitch-with-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-Stream-to-Twitch-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Stream to Twitch with OBS"></a>Part 2: Stream to Twitch with OBS</h2><p>If you want to obtain the very greatest quality broadcast, you’re searching for some fantastic software. In the case of Windows, one of the most common solutions is Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) (OBS). Many people are first drawn to OBS since it’s free to use owing to being open source. Luckily, it’s also a feature-rich piece of software that can handle practically anything you throw at it. If you’re new to OBS or to streaming in general, it might be a bit frightening at first.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Getting-a-Stream-Key-from-Twitch"><a href="#Step-1-Getting-a-Stream-Key-from-Twitch" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Getting a Stream Key from Twitch"></a>Step 1. Getting a Stream Key from Twitch</h3><p>Before you stream anything anyplace, you need to provide OBS with the credentials to broadcast on your channel. Exactly how you do this on the large number of services OBS supports may differ, but I’m covering Twitch for this instruction.</p><p>In all circumstances, you need to either produce a stream key in your account settings on the appropriate provider or link your account to OBS if it’s supported like it is on Twitch. Simply signing in with your credentials is by far the simplest approach, and OBS utilizes streaming, so you’re not providing any of your personal login information directly to it. YouTube likewise offers a similar kind of authentication.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitch.jpg"                      alt="twitch"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Installing-and-Setting-OBS"><a href="#Step-2-Installing-and-Setting-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Step 2. Installing and Setting OBS"></a>Step 2. Installing and Setting OBS</h3><p>OBS Studio is available for all main operating systems such as Windows, Mac OS, and, Linux. You may get the utility by clicking here. Run and install the software to get started. When you launch the program for the first time, OBS Studio performs an Auto-Configuration Wizard. It provides you the choice of selecting between ‘Optimize for streaming’ and ‘Optimize for recording’. Click on the ‘Optimize for streaming’ if you wish to live broadcast your game. The wizard will next examine your system’s performance. It examines and helps adjust your system resolution, bitrate, encoder, and internet connection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/installing-and-setting-obs.jpg"                      alt="installing and setting obs"                ></p><h3 id="Step-3-Configuring-OBS-Studio-for-Streaming-to-Twitch"><a href="#Step-3-Configuring-OBS-Studio-for-Streaming-to-Twitch" class="headerlink" title="Step 3. Configuring OBS Studio for Streaming to Twitch"></a>Step 3. Configuring OBS Studio for Streaming to Twitch</h3><p>Now that you’re set up to the stream, the first step is to select your resolution, frame rate, and bitrate. The greater each of them, the more bandwidth and horsepower you’ll require from your PC. If you’ve got a high-speed internet connection and a strong PC, then you can probably stream at 1080p60 at a high bitrate. But you also need to balance this with offering a stream that’s not going to buffer like wild for your viewers who could be on poorer connections. Remember, if you’re not a partner on Twitch, you won’t have transcoding, thus the experience might be awful for viewers with sluggish connections.</p><p>Once you’re done setting up OBS, you can dig into the advanced capabilities such as OBS sceneries. These will allow you to dramatically boost your live stream production value. If you arrange your OBS scenes and sources appropriately, your broadcast may go from an ordinary-looking stream to one that appears slick and professional.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/configuring-obs-studio.jpg"                      alt="configuring obs studio"                ></p><h3 id="Step-4-Adding-Scene-and-Sources"><a href="#Step-4-Adding-Scene-and-Sources" class="headerlink" title="Step 4. Adding Scene and Sources"></a>Step 4. Adding Scene and Sources</h3><p>A scene may be simply added in OBS by clicking on the addition symbol indicated in the picture below. Once you have chosen this, you will simply be prompted to pick a name for the scene. All of your overlays, sources, and basic on-screen items will need to be introduced through a specified scene. Once you have created your scene and titled it, make sure it is chosen and proceed to the box on the right side of the picture below to click the plus symbol. This brings up the many sources you may pick from for your freshly constructed scenario. The good thing is, once you have inserted a source in one scene, you can simply use it again in another.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adding-scene-and-sources.jpg"                      alt="adding scene and sources"                ></p><h3 id="Step-5-Adding-a-Twitch-Chat"><a href="#Step-5-Adding-a-Twitch-Chat" class="headerlink" title="Step 5. Adding a Twitch Chat"></a>Step 5. Adding a Twitch Chat</h3><p>Adding your twitch chat to your broadcasts may help make your viewers feel more included by enabling them to see their message live on the screen. You may add your Twitch chat box to your live broadcast in OBS by utilizing the browser source. The best practice when employing a chat box is to make sure to have your visuals, displays, and overlays set up to accommodate it. Get the widget URL from your favorite provider and copy it to your clipboard. This is what you will be adding to your OBS sources to add the chat to your overlay. If you’re using Twitch, this will be provided to you once you pick your basic settings for your chat style and layout. In the “Sources” section of OBS, go to the “+” in the bottom left corner, and pick, “Browser” to create a new browser source window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitch-chat.jpg"                      alt="twitch chat"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Stream-to-YouTube-with-OBS"><a href="#Part-3-Stream-to-YouTube-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Stream to YouTube with OBS"></a>Part 3: Stream to YouTube with OBS</h2><p>You may get it by browsing OBS Studio’s official website. If you’re using Windows 11, you shouldn’t be concerned about compatibility, since OBS is completely tuned to function with it. You may also broadcast game videos on YouTube. YouTube Gaming is a service devoted to gaming content providers and their viewers. Similar to Twitch and Facebook Gaming, it’s YouTube’s area for the gaming community. Once you’re done downloading and installing OBS, run it. You should be welcomed with a window with a dark screen and objects below it.</p><p>**<strong>Get your YouTube Stream Key</strong></p><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a YouTube account if you haven’t already</p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> You can’t participate in YouTube live broadcasting unless you authenticate the account using a connected cell phone.

How to Record Webinar on iPhone"></a>Part 3. How to Record Webinar on iPhone</h2><p>If you are attending any webinar from your iPhone, you can go for free record webinar without installing any third-party app. This is because iOS 11 and above comes with a built-in screen recorder through which you can record anything on your iPhone screen. You can find the screen recorder on the Control Center. If it is not available, you have to go to Settings&gt; Control Center &gt; Screen Recording and turn on the screen recorder option. Here are the steps on how to record webinar on iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="iphone screen recorder"                ></p><p>Step 1: Open the webinar on your screen that you want to record.</p><p>Step 2: Pull down Control Centre on your iPhone.
