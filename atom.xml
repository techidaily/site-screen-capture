Chill, you don’t need a professional studio for this purpose. There is a lot of software, but zoom podcast recording is relatively more straightforward. A podcast is a collection of audio files that you can either download or listen to online using the internet. This article will help you learn to record podcasts using zoom.</p><h2 id="7-Step-Formula-How-To-Record-a-Podcast-on-Zoom"><a href="#7-Step-Formula-How-To-Record-a-Podcast-on-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="7-Step Formula: How To Record a Podcast on Zoom?"></a>7-Step Formula: How To Record a Podcast on Zoom?</h2><p>Recording a podcast on zoom is quite simple and easy. You don’t need to be a recording expert; you can get it done at home using your laptop. In this article, I will guide you on how to record a podcast using zoom step by step.</p><h5 id="Step1-Download-and-Install"><a href="#Step1-Download-and-Install" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Download and Install"></a>Step1 Download and Install</h5><p>The 1st step is downloading and installing zoom on your device. Next, create your zoom account by visiting the <a class="link"   href="https://soft-portal.shop/zoom/?url=https://zoom.us&id=5&geo=&ub=https://soft-portal.shop/zoom/&gclid=Cj0KCQjw48OaBhDWARIsAMd966AtsDXlasyuqO9r1vrbTzSdxKyOMLNsfNLa_RFZ12PRcu09P4sKnMcaAlUHEALw_wcB" >zoom website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Log in to this account with your installed software and enjoy zoom free. The free version allows you to record for 40 minutes. For longer calls, purchase the paid version.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-1.jpg"                      alt="download and install zoom"                ></p><h5 id="Step2-Setting-Up-Microphone-and-Headphones"><a href="#Step2-Setting-Up-Microphone-and-Headphones" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Setting Up Microphone and Headphones"></a>Step2 Setting Up Microphone and Headphones</h5><p>Zoom can use your device’s built-in microphone, but it is advised to use a high-quality external mic. It enhances the quality of your podcast tremendously. Plenty of external mics are available for under 50$, which can make a real difference.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-2.jpg"                      alt="set up microphone and headphones"                ></p><h5 id="Step3-Eliminate-Any-Background-Noise"><a href="#Step3-Eliminate-Any-Background-Noise" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Eliminate Any Background Noise"></a>Step3 Eliminate Any Background Noise</h5><p>No one is interested in listening to what’s happening in the background while listening to your podcast. So, before pressing the ‘Record’ button, ensure your environment is as quiet as possible. You can take the following steps to reduce background noises.</p><ul><li>Turn off the fan, air conditioner, or any other noisy appliances.</li><li>Remove noisy kids, roommates, or pets.</li><li>Hang a ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign on your front door.</li><li>Shut your door and windows to avoid noise from outside sources, such as sirens, traffic horns, etc.</li><li>Avoid the rustling sound of paper or moving things around your desk.</li><li>Install noise-canceling software to filter out any background noise.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-3.jpg"                      alt="eliminate background noise"                ></p><h5 id="Step4-Set-Up-Separate-Audio-Tracks-for-Each-Speaker"><a href="#Step4-Set-Up-Separate-Audio-Tracks-for-Each-Speaker" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Set Up Separate Audio Tracks for Each Speaker"></a>Step4 Set Up Separate Audio Tracks for Each Speaker</h5><p>Wouldn’t it be easier to edit your podcast if you recorded audio tracks for each speaker separately? Zoom has this feature of recording separate audio tracks.</p><p>To enable this, go to your zoom ‘Settings’ and click on the ‘Recording’ setting. Then select “Record a separate audio file for each participant,” and you are ready to go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-4.jpg"                      alt="separate audio tracks for each speaker"                ></p><h5 id="Step5-Brief-Your-Guest-About-Zoom-Functioning-Before-You-Begin"><a href="#Step5-Brief-Your-Guest-About-Zoom-Functioning-Before-You-Begin" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Brief Your Guest About Zoom Functioning Before You Begin"></a>Step5 Brief Your Guest About Zoom Functioning Before You Begin</h5><p>If you are going live and your guest is new to zoom, it is better that you guide him briefly about the functioning of zoom. Guide your guest on how to join the call using zoom. It would be best if you also told him about the duration and topic of your podcast.</p><p>It is advised to test the microphone and headphones of your guest before starting a live podcast. Your guest does not need to download and install zoom on their device; he can join by clicking the link and entering the call from his browser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-5.jpg"                      alt="brief the guest about zoom functioning"                ></p><h5 id="Step6-Record-the-Call-Using-Zoom"><a href="#Step6-Record-the-Call-Using-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Record the Call Using Zoom"></a>Step6 Record the Call Using Zoom</h5><p>It is pretty simple to record a podcast using zoom. Here are the steps you need to follow:</p><ol><li>Click on the ‘New Meeting’ button to initiate the call.</li><li>Now click on the ‘Invite’ button.</li><li>Select ‘Copy Invitation’ and copy the ID and password of your meeting</li><li>Share the ID and passcode with your guest.</li><li>Ask your guest to join the call by clicking on the link.</li><li>After your guest joins the call, press ‘Manage Participants’ at the bottom of the screen.</li><li>You will see a list of all the participants. Please make sure everyone’s microphone is working and their voices are clear.</li><li>Click on the participant name you want to make a co-host and press the make co-host button.</li><li>Click the ‘Record’ button and turn on ‘Original Sound’ to start recording the podcast.</li><li>When the podcast is complete, click on the ‘End’ button and then click on ‘End Meeting for All.’</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-6.jpg"                      alt="record the call using zoom"                ></p><h5 id="Step7-Edit-the-Audio-File-Using-Editing-Tools"><a href="#Step7-Edit-the-Audio-File-Using-Editing-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Step7 Edit the Audio File Using Editing Tools"></a>Step7 Edit the Audio File Using Editing Tools</h5><p>At the end of the recording session, you will get two different file types. An MP4 audio file that you can edit using audio editors and an MP4 video file that you can edit and post on youtube or any other social media platform.</p><p>If you have recorded separate audio tracks for each speaker, you will get separate MP4 audio files for each speaker with that person’s name. You can edit the audio tracks with professional podcast editing software, like Audacity editor or Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-7.jpg"                      alt="edit audio using editor"                ></p><p>We have discussed how to use zoom for recording podcasts, and now we will look at the benefits of using zoom to record podcasts.</p><h3 id="The-Benefits-of-Using-Zoom-To-Record-Your-Podcasts"><a href="#The-Benefits-of-Using-Zoom-To-Record-Your-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="The Benefits of Using Zoom To Record Your Podcasts"></a>The Benefits of Using Zoom To Record Your Podcasts</h3><ul><li>You can host any podcast on zoom- a solo one where you are the speaker, hosting a speaker, or co-hosting with another podcaster.</li><li>Co-host with anyone you want with a particular social distancing meanwhile.</li><li>Share the screen with the attendees in just a few clicks.</li><li>Built-in feature splits audio and video and makes editing much more accessible.</li><li>Can accommodate multiple participants when there are more speakers</li><li>The audience may feel more involved in the discussion.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657386/16446" target="_top" id="1657386">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657386" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657386/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Limitations-of-Using-Zoom-for-Podcasts"><a href="#Limitations-of-Using-Zoom-for-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of Using Zoom for Podcasts"></a>Limitations of Using Zoom for Podcasts</h2><p>Having discussed the method to record podcasts with zoom and the benefits of using zoom, we will now discuss the limitations of zoom for podcast recording.

How to Record on PS4 with Built-in Tool"></a>Way 1. How to Record on PS4 with Built-in Tool</h2><p>The easiest way on how to record gameplay on PS4 is by using its default recording tool. However, there are certain limitations that you should be aware of. The default PS4 recording time is 15 minutes, and you can adjust the duration up to 60 minutes only. This means you cannot record a gameplay beyond 60 minutes. If you are good with the limitations, you can follow the simple steps on how to record PS4 gameplay for YouTube and Twitch below.</p><p>Step 1: Turn on your PS4 and press Share button. Go to Sharing and Broadcasts option.</p><p>Step 2: Under Sharing and Broadcasts, go to Length of Video Clip option. Here you are set the recording duration up to 60 minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-recording-duration-ps4.jpg"                      alt="set recording duration ps4"                ></p><p>Step 3: If you want to record your gameplay with your voice, go to Audio Sharing Settings option.

The recording will start automatically in the background and as soon as the set duration limit is reached, the recording will stop. However, you can also stop the recording by pressing on Share button twice again.</p><p>Step 5: You can go to the main menu and under Capture Gallery, you will find the recorded video.</p><h2 id="Way-2-How-to-Screen-Record-on-PS4-via-PC"><a href="#Way-2-How-to-Screen-Record-on-PS4-via-PC" class="headerlink" title="Way 2.

It enhances the quality of your podcast tremendously. Plenty of external mics are available for under 50$, which can make a real difference.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-2.jpg"                      alt="set up microphone and headphones"                ></p><h5 id="Step3-Eliminate-Any-Background-Noise"><a href="#Step3-Eliminate-Any-Background-Noise" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Eliminate Any Background Noise"></a>Step3 Eliminate Any Background Noise</h5><p>No one is interested in listening to what’s happening in the background while listening to your podcast. So, before pressing the ‘Record’ button, ensure your environment is as quiet as possible. You can take the following steps to reduce background noises.</p><ul><li>Turn off the fan, air conditioner, or any other noisy appliances.</li><li>Remove noisy kids, roommates, or pets.</li><li>Hang a ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign on your front door.</li><li>Shut your door and windows to avoid noise from outside sources, such as sirens, traffic horns, etc.</li><li>Avoid the rustling sound of paper or moving things around your desk.</li><li>Install noise-canceling software to filter out any background noise.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-3.jpg"                      alt="eliminate background noise"                ></p><h5 id="Step4-Set-Up-Separate-Audio-Tracks-for-Each-Speaker"><a href="#Step4-Set-Up-Separate-Audio-Tracks-for-Each-Speaker" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Set Up Separate Audio Tracks for Each Speaker"></a>Step4 Set Up Separate Audio Tracks for Each Speaker</h5><p>Wouldn’t it be easier to edit your podcast if you recorded audio tracks for each speaker separately? Zoom has this feature of recording separate audio tracks.</p><p>To enable this, go to your zoom ‘Settings’ and click on the ‘Recording’ setting. Then select “Record a separate audio file for each participant,” and you are ready to go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-4.jpg"                      alt="separate audio tracks for each speaker"                ></p><h5 id="Step5-Brief-Your-Guest-About-Zoom-Functioning-Before-You-Begin"><a href="#Step5-Brief-Your-Guest-About-Zoom-Functioning-Before-You-Begin" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Brief Your Guest About Zoom Functioning Before You Begin"></a>Step5 Brief Your Guest About Zoom Functioning Before You Begin</h5><p>If you are going live and your guest is new to zoom, it is better that you guide him briefly about the functioning of zoom. Guide your guest on how to join the call using zoom. It would be best if you also told him about the duration and topic of your podcast.</p><p>It is advised to test the microphone and headphones of your guest before starting a live podcast. Your guest does not need to download and install zoom on their device; he can join by clicking the link and entering the call from his browser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-5.jpg"                      alt="brief the guest about zoom functioning"                ></p><h5 id="Step6-Record-the-Call-Using-Zoom"><a href="#Step6-Record-the-Call-Using-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Record the Call Using Zoom"></a>Step6 Record the Call Using Zoom</h5><p>It is pretty simple to record a podcast using zoom.

An MP4 audio file that you can edit using audio editors and an MP4 video file that you can edit and post on youtube or any other social media platform.</p><p>If you have recorded separate audio tracks for each speaker, you will get separate MP4 audio files for each speaker with that person’s name.

Its features, such as a built-in recorder and separate audio tracks for each speaker, make it great for podcasting. But you can’t use it for professional purposes because it compresses the audio files and reduces their quality.</p><h3 id="3-How-do-I-host-a-podcast-on-Zoom"><a href="#3-How-do-I-host-a-podcast-on-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="3.

Create a meeting ID and passcode and invite people to your podcast by sending them the meeting ID and passcode. People can also join your meeting directly by clicking the link you provide. After people join your meeting, you can host a podcast. If you want to publish your podcast, you can start recording it from settings, edit it, and post it.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>In this article, we learned that recording and editing podcasts using suitable software is pretty straightforward. Zoom is ideal for hosting and recording podcasts for beginners.</p><p>Zoom alternatives such as Wondershare Filmora can be used to record podcasts for more professional use. In addition, Filmora can record a podcast in much better quality. Another advantage of preferring Filmora over zoom is its editing capability.</p><p>Edit your recorded podcast using Filmora’s unique transitions and effects and post it on youtube, Vimeo, or any other

Understand that, Valheim is a highly prominent Norse-themed game that is filled with monsters. However, the Valheim seeds are vital for everybody, including the hermits and the speedrunners. More so, Valheim is regarded as a Viking survival simulator. As a player of Valheim, you will be dropped in a mythological Norse world with nothing but your clothes and a request from the mighty Odin. The request states that you should conquer all the forsaken monstrous beasts roaming the lands. Though it seems easy, it gets tricky as you begin to explore the tenth Norse world. As you explore, you will notice that your food resources are getting scarce. While you may be thinking of how to get food, you can grow some crops. In Valheim, you can turn almost all areas into farmlands. Before you delve into planting Valheim seeds, you will need to choose the world you want to begin your adventure. Note that you will be exploring various biomes to get materials and food to survive. The aim is to be the best Viking in this purgatory-looking world.</p><p>This is done easily as the Valheim game will ask players to input their Valheim world seeds or leave the game to select anyone for them. The seeds are a series of numbers and letters. And, they build a generated world that comes with biomes, resources, and, not to forget, enemies.</p><h2 id="The-Best-Valheim-Seeds"><a href="#The-Best-Valheim-Seeds" class="headerlink" title="The Best Valheim Seeds"></a><strong>The Best Valheim Seeds</strong></h2><p>Since each seed will create a different world from the other worlds, you must check our list to find the best Valheim seeds for mining or speedrunners.</p><p> <em>“Note: The seed you select should be in direct line with your preferences in the game. ”</em></p><p>The Valheim players can use their world seeds to enter a world that has well-known challenges and layouts. Every world in this game gets a unique seed code for players to move around quickly. With the seed codes, players can keep notes of every saved world that they create.</p><p>Some of the best Valheim seeds include:</p><h3 id="1-Seed-htsE7kJL5K"><a href="#1-Seed-htsE7kJL5K" class="headerlink" title="1.Seed: htsE7kJL5K"></a>1.Seed: htsE7kJL5K</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-1.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-1"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014854/22899" target="_top" id="2014854">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014854" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014854/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Since you may want your private Island far away from everything you know, this seed is the ideal one to plant. Aside from trying to get far away, the biomes in Valheim are filled with horrible creatures that can appear at your base whenever they like and destroy everything.</p><p>Nevertheless, this is the seed you know for those who want a piece of land free from any monstrous atrocities. You will spawn it on a small island in the middle of the sea. And, the nearest boss here is Eikthyr. With such a seed, your inner Viking can be aligned with you to build a ship and sail further with plans on discovering newer lands.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1155462">                    <video width="1024" height="576" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1155462.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1155462">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1155462.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:640px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fpropmoneyinc.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1155462%2F14559'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1155462/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Seed-HHcLC5acQt"><a href="#2-Seed-HHcLC5acQt" class="headerlink" title="2.Seed: HHcLC5acQt"></a>2.Seed: HHcLC5acQt</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-2.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-2"                ></p><p>It is regarded as the ideal seed for the speedrunners in Valheim. Players in this world seed can spawn within a starter island with roughly four runes, close by traders and nearby bosses. The biomes here are in a distinct starter continent, plus the fifth boss can be likened to be as close as a raft that skips away. This seed is the perfect realm for the players that want to speedrun their game. While this world comes with four bosses, Haldor is on the Island as well. More so, players will find the fifth boss on a neighboring island.</p><h3 id="3-Seed-0V5BZHkqY4"><a href="#3-Seed-0V5BZHkqY4" class="headerlink" title="3.Seed: 0V5BZHkqY4"></a>3.Seed: 0V5BZHkqY4</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-3.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-3"                ></p><p>Even if you think that you are the best in Valheim, you will need to learn how to build a ship to sail and discover materials and biomes. If you never knew, sailing does have a learning curve. First of all, you will need to get the necessary ingredients to make a vessel; then, the next thing is to learn the difference between the three boat types available and how to use the wind on your side.</p><p> <em>“Note: the boat types are Karve, longship, and raft. ”</em></p><p>While in the water, it is advisable to look out for horrifying serpents that dwell in the ocean.

Understand that, Valheim is a highly prominent Norse-themed game that is filled with monsters. However, the Valheim seeds are vital for everybody, including the hermits and the speedrunners. More so, Valheim is regarded as a Viking survival simulator. As a player of Valheim, you will be dropped in a mythological Norse world with nothing but your clothes and a request from the mighty Odin. The request states that you should conquer all the forsaken monstrous beasts roaming the lands. Though it seems easy, it gets tricky as you begin to explore the tenth Norse world. As you explore, you will notice that your food resources are getting scarce. While you may be thinking of how to get food, you can grow some crops. In Valheim, you can turn almost all areas into farmlands. Before you delve into planting Valheim seeds, you will need to choose the world you want to begin your adventure. Note that you will be exploring various biomes to get materials and food to survive. The aim is to be the best Viking in this purgatory-looking world.</p><p>This is done easily as the Valheim game will ask players to input their Valheim world seeds or leave the game to select anyone for them. The seeds are a series of numbers and letters. And, they build a generated world that comes with biomes, resources, and, not to forget, enemies.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-reimagine-your-farm-in-stardew-valley-with-these-7-mods/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Reimagine Your Farm in Stardew Valley with These 7 Mods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-5-outstanding-racing-simulations-for-gamers-for-2024/"><u>[New] 5 Outstanding Racing Simulations for Gamers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-improve-productivity-learn-to-record-macs-screen-using-shortcut-keys/"><u>[New] In 2024, Improve Productivity Learn to Record Mac's Screen Using Shortcut Keys</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-perfect-your-presentation-essential-strategies-for-video-length-reduction-in-vimeo/"><u>[New] In 2024, Perfect Your Presentation Essential Strategies for Video Length Reduction in Vimeo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-no-flair-just-facts-dissecting-recordcast-for-2024/"><u>[New] No Flair, Just Facts Dissecting RecordCast for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-top-free-video-capture-apps-exploring-the-leaders-for-2024/"><u>[New] Top Free Video Capture Apps – Exploring the Leaders for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-financial-fortitude-for-youtubers-beyond-basic-earnings-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Financial Fortitude for YouTubers Beyond Basic Earnings for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-getting-started-with-adobe-presenter-video-recordings/"><u>[Updated] Getting Started with Adobe Presenter Video Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-navigating-live-streams-on-youtube-and-twitch-with-ease-via-obs/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Navigating Live Streams on YouTube & Twitch with Ease via OBS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-perfect-play-5-outstanding-gba-console-emulators-on-desktop-pcs/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Perfect Play 5 Outstanding GBA Console Emulators on Desktop PCs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-vote-ventures-5-top-political-game-showdowns/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Vote-Ventures 5 Top Political Game Showdowns</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-unlocking-the-power-of-voice-transcription-in-whatsapp-recording/"><u>[Updated] Unlocking the Power of Voice Transcription in WhatsApp Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/complete-tiktok-termination-protocol-unveiled/"><u>Complete TikTok Termination Protocol Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/elite-tint-modifier-app/"><u>Elite Tint Modifier App</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-migrate-android-data-from-poco-m6-pro-4g-to-new-android-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Migrate Android Data From Poco M6 Pro 4G to New Android Phone? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-kinemaster-tutorial-seamless-integration-of-green-screen-techniques/"><u>In 2024, Kinemaster Tutorial Seamless Integration of Green Screen Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-6-ways-to-transfer-text-messages-from-sony-xperia-10-v-to-other-android-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 6 Ways to Transfer Text Messages from Sony Xperia 10 V to Other Android Devices | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-reviews.techidaily.com/inside-look-toms-computer-guide/"><u>Inside Look: Tom's Computer Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/speedy-strategies-storing-slideshow-scripts-for-2024/"><u>Speedy Strategies Storing Slideshow Scripts for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-rankings.techidaily.com/the-risks-of-debloating-your-windows-pc-alternative-strategies-for-optimal-performance/"><u>The Risks of Debloating Your Windows PC: Alternative Strategies for Optimal Performance</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

While Microsoft is still working to make the ‘Blur’ option enable for all the devices, no official statement from the organization has been released to date.</p><p>On the other hand, if your computer has AVX2 and you still cannot see the option, you can try a couple of things, and see if any of those works for you. For instance, you can:</p><ul><li>Sign out of Teams and then sign back in</li><li>Check for and update the webcam driver</li><li>Check for and install the most updated version of Microsoft Teams</li><li>Restart your computer</li></ul><p><strong>Q2) Can I blur the background in the Teams Business version?</strong></p><p><strong>A2)</strong> Yes, you can. Microsoft Teams (Free), Microsoft 365 Business Basic, and Microsoft 365 Business Standard versions allow you to blur the background with ease.

They can also join it through Gmail. Joining a Meet conference through Gmail is exceptionally easy. All you have to do is follow the steps outlined below.</p><p>First, go over to the Gmail website and log in to your Gmail account. Once you have done that, near the bottom left side of your screen you will see two options; “Start a meeting” and “Join a meeting”. To join a meeting through a conference link or code, click “Join a meeting”.</p><p>Upon clicking the “Join a meeting” button, a popup will appear on the screen asking for the meeting code. Here, enter in the meeting code provided to you and click “Join”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/join-google-meet-on-gmail.jpg"                      alt="join in google meet  on Gmail"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137218/26400" target="_top" id="2137218">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137218" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137218/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The user will be redirected to the main joining screen of Google Meet, where they must click “Join” again to enter the conference.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Join-A-Scheduled-Google-Meet-From-a-Google-Calendar-Event"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Join-A-Scheduled-Google-Meet-From-a-Google-Calendar-Event" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Join A Scheduled Google Meet From a Google Calendar Event?"></a>Part 3: How to Join A Scheduled Google Meet From a Google Calendar Event?</h2><p>Google makes use of very centralized processes, all its applications and functions are integrated. Therefore, you can even join a Google Meet Conference from Google Calendar. However, in this case, an event must be scheduled first by the host, and the participant who is looking to join must be a guest in the event. If you match this criterion then head on over to your Google Calendar to join Google Meet conferences.</p><p>Google Calendar automatically opens to the current day, so all your events from that day are visible on your screen, as shown in the image below.</p><p>From those events, click on the event which you would like to join and a popup will appear on your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/join-google-meet-google-calendar.jpg"                      alt="join in google meet  on calendar"                ></p><p>On the pop-up, users can see a button saying “Join with Google Meet”, click that button and users will automatically be redirected to the main joining page of Google Meet.</p><p>Upon landing on the main joining page, click “Join” and you will become a part of the Meet session you wanted to join.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Join-Google-Meet-Using-Link"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Join-Google-Meet-Using-Link" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Join Google Meet Using Link?"></a>Part 4: How to Join Google Meet Using Link?</h2><p>Did someone invite you to a Google Meet session and send a link instead of the code? Well, you can still join the meeting with a link only as well. The process is very similar to that of joining with a Google Meet code.</p><h3 id="1-Directly-Joining-Through-URL-Bar"><a href="#1-Directly-Joining-Through-URL-Bar" class="headerlink" title="1. Directly Joining Through URL Bar"></a>1. Directly Joining Through URL Bar</h3><p>The quickest and easiest way to join with a link is by directly pasting it in the URL bar on your desktop or laptop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/join-in-google-meet-with-link-browser.jpg"                      alt="join in google meet  with link on browser"                ></p><p>Click enter and you will automatically be redirected to the Google Meet main joining page.</p><p>After being redirected to the joining page, you will have options to mute your microphone or turn off the camera, work with the options according to your needs.

Join A Meeting With A Link Through The Google Meet Website"></a>2. Join A Meeting With A Link Through The Google Meet Website</h3><p>Another way through which individuals can join Google Meet using a link is through the Google Meet website. First, you must open the Google Meet website.</p><p>After opening the website, find the text box which says “Enter a code or link”, paste the link over there and click “Join”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/join-google-meet-with-link-website.jpg"                      alt="join in google meet  with link on website"                ></p><p>Once that is done, the participant will be redirected to the main joining page of Google Meet from where they can continue to the session.</p><h3 id="3-Join-A-Meeting-With-A-Link-Through-Google-Calendar"><a href="#3-Join-A-Meeting-With-A-Link-Through-Google-Calendar" class="headerlink" title="3. Join A Meeting With A Link Through Google Calendar"></a>3. Join A Meeting With A Link Through Google Calendar</h3><p>If the first two methods just aren’t working out for you, you can also join the session using the Google Calendar. Remember, to use this option, one must have a pre-scheduled meeting in place and they must be invited by the host. If that is the case then you are good to go!</p><p>Make your way over to the Google Calendar website and you will find all your events for a certain day displayed on your screen.</p><p>Click on the event which has been scheduled for the Google Meet session that you would like to join and a popup will appear on your screen like the one attached below.</p><p>On the popup you can see a button which says “Join with Google Meet” and just below that, you can find a link to the Meet session as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-link-google-calendar.jpg"                      alt="join in google meet  with link on calendar"                ></p><p>Copy the link from there and paste it into the URL bar. Press enter and you will be redirected over to the main Google Meet joining page.</p><p>Click “Join” and voila! You will have entered the Google Meet conference that you were trying to join.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Join-Google-Meet-On-Mobile-App"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Join-Google-Meet-On-Mobile-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Join Google Meet On Mobile App?"></a>Part 5: How to Join Google Meet On Mobile App?</h2><p>There are times when you just do not have your laptop on you, that’s when people prefer to use Google Meet on their mobile devices. In a scenario such as this, <strong>Google Meet join by phone</strong> is still possible through links and codes.</p><p>Open the Google Meet application on your mobile device, this is possible on Android as well as iOS. After opening the application, click the “Join with a code” button displayed on your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/join-google-meet-mobile-device.jpg"                      alt="join in google meet on mobile devices"                ></p><p>After clicking this button, Google Meet will ask for the meeting code.

Well, not everybody has a Google Account, but they can still join a Google Meet conference! However, there are a few factors they must know off.</p><p>In order to join a Google Meet without a Google Account, the user must get a conference link or code from the host of the session. The users cannot create a meeting themselves. Additionally, individuals who are looking to join a Google Meet session without a Google Account should be aware that they can only use the desktop version to join a meeting, they cannot make use of the mobile application.</p><p>The steps which one must follow to Join Google Meet Without A Google Account are outlined below.</p><p>They must receive a joining code&#x2F; link from the meeting host.

Apex Legends is one of the top games on our list. Despite borrowing many elements from its contemporaries, it has unique features of its own, like its Legends, where each has its own personality and gameplay mechanics that distinguish it from the rest. In addition to using engaging seasonal content, Apex Legends also features in-game events that engage players.</p><p>The thing that puts Apex above the rest is its fast-paced, high-quality gameplay that is unlike any other. It is undoubtedly the best of its kind thanks to its focus on storytelling and fluid gameplay. As soon as you get used to Apex Legends’ movement, you won’t be able to play other slower-paced battle royale games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Combat that moves at a breakneck pace.</p><p>• The best movement in the industry.</p><p>• Hero characters give the battle royale genre an interesting twist.</p><p>• There is something unique about every Legend.</p><p>• Using Ping, you can communicate with anyone, anywhere.</p><p>• Squads of 3.</p><p>• You can play it for free.</p><h3 id="3-Call-of-Duty-Warzone"><a href="#3-Call-of-Duty-Warzone" class="headerlink" title="3.Call of Duty: Warzone"></a>3.Call of Duty: Warzone</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-of-duty-warzone-poster.png"                      alt="call-of-duty-warzone-poster"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135351/19272" target="_top" id="2135351">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135351" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135351/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X&#x2F;S, PC</p><p>The world we live in exhibits a remarkable timeline, one where an extremely popular video game can be played for free, is published by Activision and is based on a potentially huge franchise. We live in such a remarkable world. With a few tricks up its sleeve, Call of Duty: Warzone enters the battle royale fray of competitive multiplayer games.</p><p>Warzone is based on the 2019 reboot of Modern Warfare. In addition, to respawn matches, loadout kits, and other unique battle royale elements differentiate Warzone from its competitors and greatly impact its gameplay. It is hit-or-miss in terms of these additions, but the package as a whole is quite polished. Although it is referred to as a battle royale game, Warzone will appeal to traditional first-person shooter fans.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Map with a lot of information.</p><p>• Gunplay that is fast and responsive.</p><p>• Since there are so many players and there are frequent skirmishes, you can gain something from virtually every match.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880944/19272" target="_top" id="1880944">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880944" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880944/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Fall-Guys-Ultimate-Knockout"><a href="#4-Fall-Guys-Ultimate-Knockout" class="headerlink" title="4.Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout"></a>4.Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-poster.png"                      alt="fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4 (Coming to Android, iOS, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch in the future)</p><p>It’s the way Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout accommodates all players that make it so great. Despite that, this game is extremely enjoyable even if you’re not a professional gamer. You can expect to see up to 60 players battling each other for supremacy in this game. As you move through the mini-game rounds, fewer players make the cut, and eventually, there’s only one.</p><p>You’ll run, jump, and climb across obstacles in this game, but its quirky presentation makes the experience all the more appealing. One of the best battle royale games out there is Fall Guy, thanks to the colorful characters and the exciting gameplay.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Playing this game is simple and addictive.</p><p>• The design is colorful and friendly for everyone.</p><p>• A structure that rewards round-based performance.</p><h3 id="5-PlayerUnknown’s-Battlegrounds"><a href="#5-PlayerUnknown’s-Battlegrounds" class="headerlink" title="5.PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds"></a>5.PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/playerunknowns-battlegrounds-poster.png"                      alt="playerunknowns-battlegrounds-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PlayStation 4 Xbox One, Android, and iOS</p><p>All Battle Royale games have an interesting origin story, but PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, or PUBG, has a particularly intriguing story. Before being licensed by Sony Online Entertainment for use in H1Z1, PUBG began as an Arma 2 and Arma 3 mod. Bluehole Studio hired Brendan Greene as a Creative Director of PUBG. This was when PUBG became PUBG.</p><p>A feature boasted by its biggest rival, PUBG lacks the capability of cross-platform play. Players can participate in 100-person sessions in PUBG, and play alone, with a friend, or with a squad of four. It’s imperative that you land where you want after you drop from a plane to start the game, as you need to find armor, weapons, vehicles, and other items that’ll keep you alive when you meet other players.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Visually stunning and atmospheric.</p><p>• This is a novel concept for a battle royale.</p><p>• Growing community through active development.</p><p>• Matchmaking that happens quickly.</p><h3 id="6-Forza-Horizon-4"><a href="#6-Forza-Horizon-4" class="headerlink" title="6.Forza Horizon 4"></a>6.Forza Horizon 4</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/forza-horizon-4-poster.jpg"                      alt="forza-horizon-4-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Xbox One, Xbox Series X&#x2F;S, PC</p><p>Forza Horizon 4 is not a Battle Royale game, but its new Eliminator mode adds a level of similarity. In The Eliminator, 72 players compete to be the last person standing as the zone closes in around them.</p><p>Into the mix comes Forza Horizon 5, which features a huge open world and some stunning scenery from Mexico. Cross-platform support is also available in Forza Horizon 4, though only for Windows and Xbox.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• An open-world full of activities and stunning visuals.</p><p>• A total of 450 cars are licensed for the event.</p><p>• Amazing variety and depth of detail.</p><p>• Almost as good as ever, with so many vehicles to unlock.</p><p>• It gives the impression that the world is dynamic because of online functionality.</p><h3 id="7-Spellbreak"><a href="#7-Spellbreak" class="headerlink" title="7.Spellbreak"></a>7.Spellbreak</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/spellbreak-poster.jpg"                      alt="spellbreak-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X&#x2F;S, Nintendo Switch, PC</p><p>Battle Royale fans will enjoy Spellbreak. A multiplayer shooter allows dozens of players to battle it out on an ever-shrinking battlefield filled with weapons. Using a violent, magical aesthetic instead of a violent, military aesthetic, Spellbreak makes a great change.</p><p>The game is played using elemental spells in place of guns. You can combine these powers into devastating attacks by upgrading them to stronger versions. A cloud of poison gas can be set ablaze to create a satisfying effect. Players can move freely in Spellbreak, which turns skirmishes into heroic fights along with explosive combat. Want to retreat for a while? Simply release a bolt of lightning.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Battle royale genre reimagined in an engaging, approachable way.</p><p>• A system for creating magic combats.</p><p>• The art style is very post-apocalyptic and fantasy-like.</p><p>• Profiles and cross-platform multiplayer are carried over.</p><h3 id="8-SUPER-ANIMAL-ROYALE"><a href="#8-SUPER-ANIMAL-ROYALE" class="headerlink" title="8.SUPER ANIMAL ROYALE"></a>8.SUPER ANIMAL ROYALE</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/super-animal-royale-poster.png"                      alt="super-animal-royale-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X&#x2F;S, Nintendo Switch, PC, Google Stadia</p><p>A great battle royale game that is free to play is Super Animal Royale. The game features abandoned safari park animals fighting each other with claws and guns instead of humanoid operators. The developers of Super Animal Royale have done an excellent job for an independent game.</p><p>The game can be played on almost every platform. PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X&#x2F;S, macOS, PC, Google Stadia, and Nintendo Switch are all compatible with the game. Super Animal Royale supports cross-platform play as well.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• The visuals are awesome.</p><p>• There is a lot of customization available.</p><p>• There are plenty of unique ideas.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398449/3022" target="_top" id="398449">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398449" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398449/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="9-Totally-Accurate-Battlegrounds"><a href="#9-Totally-Accurate-Battlegrounds" class="headerlink" title="9.Totally Accurate Battlegrounds"></a>9.Totally Accurate Battlegrounds</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/totally-accurate-battlegrounds-poster.png"                      alt="totally-accurate-battlegrounds-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</p><p>The next game takes a silly approach to the formula, and we’re glad it exists. It’s a comedic shooter parody that targets serious shooter franchises like PUBG (hence the name). There are up to 60 players in lobbies, so obviously, you’ve got to be the last team standing. When shot, players are ragdolled to oblivion, which adds to the humor.</p><p>It is an ambitious, chaotic work, with crude artwork, over-the-top weapons and items, and a wonderfully chaotic premise. A good first-person shooting game ties the whole thing together, so it’s difficult to put it down. Its design ensures that the gameplay never feels like it is pushed to the background by the jokes, which speaks volumes about the game.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Multiplayer action that is addicting.</p><p>• Introducing a novel concept of “battle royale”.</p><p>• Support from a large community of developers.</p><p>• Each match is unique due to unpredictable variables.</p><h3 id="10-Ring-of-Elysium"><a href="#10-Ring-of-Elysium" class="headerlink" title="10.Ring of Elysium"></a>10.Ring of Elysium</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ring-of-elysium-poster.jpg"                      alt="ring-of-elysium-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</p><p>The Battle Royale game Kicking Things Off capitalizes on the popularity of the genre but comes with enough uniqueness to stand out. In addition to snowboards, hang gliders, and even grappling hooks for getting around the map, its main standout feature is how you move around it.</p><p>Each successive season of the game has had a different weather type, setting, and even volcanic ash to overcome for you. Season 1 was snow-themed, but other seasons have focused on storms and even nuclear power plants. During the final moments of a game, Ring of Elysium also features a rescue helicopter that allows up to four players to make it to the end - resulting in some tense moments. It’s not perfect, but it’s still a blast.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• World-building and graphics are beautiful.</p><p>• Play in a variety of ways.</p><p>• Battle Royale in a different light.</p><h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h2><p>Those are our recommendations for the 10 best battle royale games you can play this year on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC, among other platforms.

Apex Legends is one of the top games on our list. Despite borrowing many elements from its contemporaries, it has unique features of its own, like its Legends, where each has its own personality and gameplay mechanics that distinguish it from the rest. In addition to using engaging seasonal content, Apex Legends also features in-game events that engage players.</p><p>The thing that puts Apex above the rest is its fast-paced, high-quality gameplay that is unlike any other.

It is true that these games are not very graphically intense and can’t compete for the AAA titles, but it won’t be fair to compare them with those heavy and graphics-intensive games. Played repeatedly, these games continue to keep players interested even after they are released for years. But who cares that much if you’re just looking for some good rogue game to play.</p><h2 id="What-is-a-roguelike-game-What-is-a-roguelite-game"><a href="#What-is-a-roguelike-game-What-is-a-roguelite-game" class="headerlink" title="What is a roguelike game? What is a roguelite game?"></a>What is a roguelike game? What is a roguelite game?</h2><p>Gamers have been debating whether roguelikes are different from roguelites for years. If you study them in general, you will find that both roguelikes and roguelites are the RPGs subgenres. In general, roguelikes and roguelites place more emphasis on death than other kinds of video games do.</p><p>You might have a question in your mind that what is a <strong>roguelike game</strong>? It is a convoluted category of games, but it had a clear beginning. It all started with an early dungeon crawling game, “Rogue” in 1980. At that time, computers were very limited in their speed and memory capabilities.</p><p>You have to give credit to the computer programmers because instead of taking the low memory capacity of computers as a limitation at that time, they developed a game and introduced the concept of “procedural generation to save the memory space.” If you have ever played a game that has randomly generated level systems and each time gives you a unique experience, then you have already tried a roguelike game or a roguelite game.</p><p>In roguelikes, players’ progress is usually lost if they die, while in roguelites, rewards or progression are usually saved between runs. This is the main difference between roguelikes and roguelites. Although there are many other differences, let’s focus on discussing the best roguelike games and roguelite games present today.</p><p><strong>Want a more detailed explanation?

So, let’s get started without wasting any time.</p><hr><h2 id="1-Darkest-Dungeon"><a href="#1-Darkest-Dungeon" class="headerlink" title="1.Darkest Dungeon"></a><strong>1.<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/262060/Darkest%5FDungeon/" >Darkest Dungeon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platform:</em></strong> <em>PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, iOS</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 24.99.</em></p><p>In Darkest Dungeon, your misery is manifest all around you. The oppressive visuals, brutal difficulty, and extreme bleakness make the game feel so oppressive in the extreme. With its dungeons and scavenger hunts, it keeps you on the edge of your seat, looking for treasure and gold.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/darkest-dungeon.png"                      alt="darkest-dungeon"                ></p><p>It’s one thing to defeat each dungeon’s horrifying inhabitants in turn-based combat, but your party members should also be more than meat shields. Your expeditions will inevitably take a toll on your body and mind, and this is the main reason that makes Darkest Dungeon so challenging.</p><p>Your tactical instincts will be put to the test when it comes to teamwork and resource allocation. This is undoubtedly one of the best roguelikes to be found.</p><h2 id="2-Downwell"><a href="#2-Downwell" class="headerlink" title="2.Downwell"></a><strong>2.<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/360740/Downwell/" >Downwell <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>PS4, Switch, PC, iOS, Android</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 2.99.</em></p><p>Only a couple of minutes to complete each run, this roguelike takes us on an adventure on the inside. As you dive deeper into an endless well filled with dangerous creatures, you are only protected by a pair of deadly gumboots that kill enemies, slowing down your fall for a moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/downwell.png"                      alt="downwell"                ></p><p>Don’t let its retro look fool you. This 2015 title is fast and intense, with a good amount of power-ups that boost your survivability. It is immediately enjoyable with its fast-paced downward action, but gaining mastery of its combat is no simple feat. Downwell is one of the best roguelikes out there, despite its intense difficulty. Its concise levels, satisfying combo system, and creative boss are among the roguelikes’ best features.</p><h2 id="3-Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup"><a href="#3-Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup" class="headerlink" title="3. Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup"></a><strong>3. <a class="link"   href="https://crawl.develz.org/" >Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>Android, Web browser</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>Free To Play</em></p><p>The successor to the 1997’s roguelike Liney’s Dungeon Crawl, Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup is another best roguelike game. Although there is a considerable saturation in the roguelike titles these days, we had to include this classic title in the best roguelike games list because it deserves a spot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dungeon-crawl-stone-soup.png"                      alt="dungeon-crawl-stone-soup"                ></p><p>Each item, class, spell, and trait in this community-developed game has hundreds of hidden interactions that just heighten your enjoyment every time you play. Each floor increases the game’s difficulty, and as you go deeper, it becomes harder to decide whether to fight or flee.</p><h2 id="4-Hades"><a href="#4-Hades" class="headerlink" title="4. Hades"></a><strong>4. <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/" >Hades <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong>   <em>Nintendo Switch, macOS, Microsoft Windows, Macintosh operating systems</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 8.49.</em></p><p>Hades is a masterpiece when it comes to dungeon crawling and roguelike games. Your character is Hades’ son, Zagreus, trying to escape from the Underworld and make his way to Mount Olympus. Hades’ cyclical narrative is presented through its procedural runs and a compelling story and evocative cast of characters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hades.png"                      alt="hades"                ></p><p>Many blessings have been given to you by the gods of Olympus, but your quest is not an easy one. A game like this will enthrall you and entice you to keep playing until you get some better stuff for your characters. After each failure, you are resurrected in your own house, the House of Hades, where your friends and family await your following conversation. It is one of the best roguelike titles out there.</p><h2 id="5-Into-the-Breach"><a href="#5-Into-the-Breach" class="headerlink" title="5. Into the Breach"></a><strong>5. <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/590380/Into%5Fthe%5FBreach/" >Into the Breach <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>Switch, PC</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 6.99</em></p><p>This is the second title developed and published by Subset Games. Their first title was FTL: <strong><em>Faster Than Light</em></strong> in 2012. FTL could have taken this spot, but Into the Breach’s design and hidden depth make it stand out among the competition. It’s a game of turn-based tactics where your team is faced with an army of monsters known as the Vek.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/into-the-breach.png"                      alt="into-the-breach"                ></p><p>There’s only one way to hold off their attack, and that is to enlist some giant mechs. But you’ll have to agonize over every decision if you intend to keep your team intact. The more you progress through the game’s islands, the more advanced equipment you’ll find, so you can turn the tide of war and save humankind.</p><p>This is one of the most accessible strategy games out there, and its straightforward combat won’t offend novices, but you should expect something more challenging, though rewarding, from Into the Breach.</p><h2 id="6-Slay-the-Spire"><a href="#6-Slay-the-Spire" class="headerlink" title="6. Slay the Spire"></a><strong>6. <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay%5Fthe%5FSpire/" >Slay the Spire <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>PS4, Switch, PC</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 8.49.</em></p><p>It foregoes combat mechanics solely in favor of strategy and premonition in a deck-building roguelike. You have no choice but to battle your way up the tower, which is also home to many monsters. This is an ideal entry point to the single-player card battler genre as it does away with the pre-battle faff. It’s also a surprising roguelike that blends options from your adventures to create an instantaneous action experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slay-the-spire.png"                      alt="slay-the-spire"                ></p><p>The game, released in 2017, has gained massive audience recognition thanks to its 10&#x2F;10 Steam rating and over 60,00 reviews despite its simplistic art and simplistic interface. It is considered the best deck-builder roguelike in the market, so if you haven’t tried it already, you miss out a lot.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036467/19272" target="_top" id="2036467">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036467" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036467/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Crypt-of-the-Necrodancer"><a href="#7-Crypt-of-the-Necrodancer" class="headerlink" title="7.

This game was released in 2015, featuring catchy soundtracks and groovy boss fights — a distinct title for gamers looking for a new challenge. While you’re running out of time before your next move, Crypt of the Necrodancer will have you tapping your foot and dripping with sweat as you keep ongoing.</p><p>This game deviates from roguelike conventions, forcing players to arrive at snappy judgments quickly. While quick decision-making and foresight are required in the genre, the escalating rhythm forces players to maintain a higher tempo to maintain a strong combo, and all you know is, you can’t lose the combo. If you haven’t tried this game yet, then it’s worth your time and money.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484940/16446" target="_top" id="1484940">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484940" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484940/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Dead-Cells"><a href="#8-Dead-Cells" class="headerlink" title="8.

You revolve around procedurally generated dungeon exploration in search of blueprints for better gear. The dungeon hosts a multitude of tough-as-nails enemies, which make finding these schematics no easy task.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deadcells-poster.png"                      alt="deadcells-poster"                ></p><p>Various upgrades can be carried over between runs, generating a constant sense of progression. Because of this, starting a new run after a particularly messy boss fight doesn’t sting quite as much as many other roguelike games might be.

It is true that these games are not very graphically intense and can’t compete for the AAA titles, but it won’t be fair to compare them with those heavy and graphics-intensive games. Played repeatedly, these games continue to keep players interested even after they are released for years.

What is a roguelite game?"></a>What is a roguelike game? What is a roguelite game?</h2><p>Gamers have been debating whether roguelikes are different from roguelites for years. If you study them in general, you will find that both roguelikes and roguelites are the RPGs subgenres. In general, roguelikes and roguelites place more emphasis on death than other kinds of video games do.</p><p>You might have a question in your mind that what is a <strong>roguelike game</strong>? It is a convoluted category of games, but it had a clear beginning. It all started with an early dungeon crawling game, “Rogue” in 1980. At that time, computers were very limited in their speed and memory capabilities.</p><p>You have to give credit to the computer programmers because instead of taking the low memory capacity of computers as a limitation at that time, they developed a game and introduced the concept of “procedural generation to save the memory space.” If you have ever played a game that has randomly generated level systems and each time gives you a unique experience, then you have already tried a roguelike game or a roguelite game.</p><p>In roguelikes, players’ progress is usually lost if they die, while in roguelites, rewards or progression are usually saved between runs. This is the main difference between roguelikes and roguelites. Although there are many other differences, let’s focus on discussing the best roguelike games and roguelite games present today.</p><p><strong>Want a more detailed explanation?

The oppressive visuals, brutal difficulty, and extreme bleakness make the game feel so oppressive in the extreme.

Your expeditions will inevitably take a toll on your body and mind, and this is the main reason that makes Darkest Dungeon so challenging.</p><p>Your tactical instincts will be put to the test when it comes to teamwork and resource allocation. This is undoubtedly one of the best roguelikes to be found.</p><h2 id="2-Downwell-1"><a href="#2-Downwell-1" class="headerlink" title="2.Downwell"></a><strong>2.<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/360740/Downwell/" >Downwell <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>PS4, Switch, PC, iOS, Android</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 2.99.</em></p><p>Only a couple of minutes to complete each run, this roguelike takes us on an adventure on the inside.

This 2015 title is fast and intense, with a good amount of power-ups that boost your survivability. It is immediately enjoyable with its fast-paced downward action, but gaining mastery of its combat is no simple feat. Downwell is one of the best roguelikes out there, despite its intense difficulty. Its concise levels, satisfying combo system, and creative boss are among the roguelikes’ best features.</p><h2 id="3-Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup-1"><a href="#3-Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

Your character is Hades’ son, Zagreus, trying to escape from the Underworld and make his way to Mount Olympus. Hades’ cyclical narrative is presented through its procedural runs and a compelling story and evocative cast of characters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hades.png"                      alt="hades"                ></p><p>Many blessings have been given to you by the gods of Olympus, but your quest is not an easy one.

Their first title was FTL: <strong><em>Faster Than Light</em></strong> in 2012. FTL could have taken this spot, but Into the Breach’s design and hidden depth make it stand out among the competition.

You have no choice but to battle your way up the tower, which is also home to many monsters. This is an ideal entry point to the single-player card battler genre as it does away with the pre-battle faff. It’s also a surprising roguelike that blends options from your adventures to create an instantaneous action experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slay-the-spire.png"                      alt="slay-the-spire"                ></p><p>The game, released in 2017, has gained massive audience recognition thanks to its 10&#x2F;10 Steam rating and over 60,00 reviews despite its simplistic art and simplistic interface.

This game was released in 2015, featuring catchy soundtracks and groovy boss fights — a distinct title for gamers looking for a new challenge. While you’re running out of time before your next move, Crypt of the Necrodancer will have you tapping your foot and dripping with sweat as you keep ongoing.</p><p>This game deviates from roguelike conventions, forcing players to arrive at snappy judgments quickly. While quick decision-making and foresight are required in the genre, the escalating rhythm forces players to maintain a higher tempo to maintain a strong combo, and all you know is, you can’t lose the combo. If you haven’t tried this game yet, then it’s worth your time and money.</p><h2 id="8-Dead-Cells-1"><a href="#8-Dead-Cells-1" class="headerlink" title="8.

You revolve around procedurally generated dungeon exploration in search of blueprints for better gear. The dungeon hosts a multitude of tough-as-nails enemies, which make finding these schematics no easy task.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deadcells-poster.png"                      alt="deadcells-poster"                ></p><p>Various upgrades can be carried over between runs, generating a constant sense of progression. Because of this, starting a new run after a particularly messy boss fight doesn’t sting quite as much as many other roguelike games might be.

The oppressive visuals, brutal difficulty, and extreme bleakness make the game feel so oppressive in the extreme. With its dungeons and scavenger hunts, it keeps you on the edge of your seat, looking for treasure and gold.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/darkest-dungeon.png"                      alt="darkest-dungeon"                ></p><p>It’s one thing to defeat each dungeon’s horrifying inhabitants in turn-based combat, but your party members should also be more than meat shields. Your expeditions will inevitably take a toll on your body and mind, and this is the main reason that makes Darkest Dungeon so challenging.</p><p>Your tactical instincts will be put to the test when it comes to teamwork and resource allocation. This is undoubtedly one of the best roguelikes to be found.</p><h2 id="2-Downwell-2"><a href="#2-Downwell-2" class="headerlink" title="2.Downwell"></a><strong>2.<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/360740/Downwell/" >Downwell <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>PS4, Switch, PC, iOS, Android</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 2.99.</em></p><p>Only a couple of minutes to complete each run, this roguelike takes us on an adventure on the inside. As you dive deeper into an endless well filled with dangerous creatures, you are only protected by a pair of deadly gumboots that kill enemies, slowing down your fall for a moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/downwell.png"                      alt="downwell"                ></p><p>Don’t let its retro look fool you. This 2015 title is fast and intense, with a good amount of power-ups that boost your survivability. It is immediately enjoyable with its fast-paced downward action, but gaining mastery of its combat is no simple feat. Downwell is one of the best roguelikes out there, despite its intense difficulty. Its concise levels, satisfying combo system, and creative boss are among the roguelikes’ best features.</p><h2 id="3-Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup-2"><a href="#3-Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

Although there is a considerable saturation in the roguelike titles these days, we had to include this classic title in the best roguelike games list because it deserves a spot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dungeon-crawl-stone-soup.png"                      alt="dungeon-crawl-stone-soup"                ></p><p>Each item, class, spell, and trait in this community-developed game has hundreds of hidden interactions that just heighten your enjoyment every time you play. Each floor increases the game’s difficulty, and as you go deeper, it becomes harder to decide whether to fight or flee.</p><h2 id="4-Hades-2"><a href="#4-Hades-2" class="headerlink" title="4.

Your character is Hades’ son, Zagreus, trying to escape from the Underworld and make his way to Mount Olympus. Hades’ cyclical narrative is presented through its procedural runs and a compelling story and evocative cast of characters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hades.png"                      alt="hades"                ></p><p>Many blessings have been given to you by the gods of Olympus, but your quest is not an easy one. A game like this will enthrall you and entice you to keep playing until you get some better stuff for your characters. After each failure, you are resurrected in your own house, the House of Hades, where your friends and family await your following conversation. It is one of the best roguelike titles out there.</p><h2 id="5-Into-the-Breach-2"><a href="#5-Into-the-Breach-2" class="headerlink" title="5.

Their first title was FTL: <strong><em>Faster Than Light</em></strong> in 2012. FTL could have taken this spot, but Into the Breach’s design and hidden depth make it stand out among the competition. It’s a game of turn-based tactics where your team is faced with an army of monsters known as the Vek.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/into-the-breach.png"                      alt="into-the-breach"                ></p><p>There’s only one way to hold off their attack, and that is to enlist some giant mechs. But you’ll have to agonize over every decision if you intend to keep your team intact. The more you progress through the game’s islands, the more advanced equipment you’ll find, so you can turn the tide of war and save humankind.</p><p>This is one of the most accessible strategy games out there, and its straightforward combat won’t offend novices, but you should expect something more challenging, though rewarding, from Into the Breach.</p><h2 id="6-Slay-the-Spire-2"><a href="#6-Slay-the-Spire-2" class="headerlink" title="6.

You have no choice but to battle your way up the tower, which is also home to many monsters. This is an ideal entry point to the single-player card battler genre as it does away with the pre-battle faff. It’s also a surprising roguelike that blends options from your adventures to create an instantaneous action experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slay-the-spire.png"                      alt="slay-the-spire"                ></p><p>The game, released in 2017, has gained massive audience recognition thanks to its 10&#x2F;10 Steam rating and over 60,00 reviews despite its simplistic art and simplistic interface. It is considered the best deck-builder roguelike in the market, so if you haven’t tried it already, you miss out a lot.</p><h2 id="7-Crypt-of-the-Necrodancer-2"><a href="#7-Crypt-of-the-Necrodancer-2" class="headerlink" title="7. Crypt of the Necrodancer"></a><strong>7. <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/247080/Crypt%5Fof%5Fthe%5FNecroDancer/" >Crypt of the Necrodancer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, iOS, Microsoft Windows, Linux, Classic Mac OS, PlayStation Vita, Xbox One</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 14.99.</em></p><p>This rhythm-based roguelike game hits a sweet spot combining two niche genres. This game was released in 2015, featuring catchy soundtracks and groovy boss fights — a distinct title for gamers looking for a new challenge. While you’re running out of time before your next move, Crypt of the Necrodancer will have you tapping your foot and dripping with sweat as you keep ongoing.</p><p>This game deviates from roguelike conventions, forcing players to arrive at snappy judgments quickly. While quick decision-making and foresight are required in the genre, the escalating rhythm forces players to maintain a higher tempo to maintain a strong combo, and all you know is, you can’t lose the combo. If you haven’t tried this game yet, then it’s worth your time and money.</p><h2 id="8-Dead-Cells-2"><a href="#8-Dead-Cells-2" class="headerlink" title="8. Dead Cells"></a><strong>8. <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead%5FCells/" >Dead Cells <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>Platforms: PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, iOS, Android</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 8.49.</em></p><p>Dead Cells is a 2D and Souls-inspired roguelike game. You revolve around procedurally generated dungeon exploration in search of blueprints for better gear. The dungeon hosts a multitude of tough-as-nails enemies, which make finding these schematics no easy task.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deadcells-poster.png"                      alt="deadcells-poster"                ></p><p>Various upgrades can be carried over between runs, generating a constant sense of progression. Because of this, starting a new run after a particularly messy boss fight doesn’t sting quite as much as many other roguelike games might be. There are many different weapon types and perks to unlock in Dead Cells, making it more replayable and keeps it from being monotonous.</p><h2 id="9-The-Binding-of-Isaac-2"><a href="#9-The-Binding-of-Isaac-2" class="headerlink" title="9. The Binding of Isaac"></a><strong>9. <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/The%5FBinding%5Fof%5FIsaac/" >The Binding of Isaac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, 3DS, iOS</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 2.99.</em></p><p>An indie roguelike developed by Super Meat Boy creator Edmund McMillen, The Binding of Isaac is an action-packed adventure game. With its action-adventure elements fused with shooters, the game is an outright sick action-adventure with an acquired taste that has become cult.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-binding-of-isaac.png"                      alt="binding-of-issac"                ></p><p>In addition to some captivating gameplay, the game contains some compelling storytelling, with Biblical references providing a nice hint of lore. Although decisions are essential in roguelikes, you may also need to be quick with your reaction times with some bullet hell-style bosses.</p><h2 id="10-Otherworld-Legends-2"><a href="#10-Otherworld-Legends-2" class="headerlink" title="10. Otherworld Legends"></a><strong>10. <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chillyroom.zhmr.gp&hl=en&gl=US" >Otherworld Legends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>Android, iOS</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>Free</em></p><p>Otherworld Legends is a mystery roguelite where you explore a mysterious and dangerous realm while discovering the mystery hidden within it. This requires equal measures of skill and perseverance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-other-world-legends.png"                      alt="the-other-world-legends"                ></p><p>As you journey through various dungeon rooms in this game, you defeat all enemies you encounter. This is similar to the binding of Isaac series of games and Elemental Dungeon. Some relics are also found or bought from time to time. These items give you powerful advantages in combat, which can be the difference between victory and defeat.</p><p>The main character of this game is Quan Huying, but there are several other characters you can choose from. You need to buy additional characters, though. They differ in cost, and some are $1.99 while others can be upwards of $2.99. It’s not expensive for me, but that doesn’t mean it’s necessarily ideal.</p><p>The Otherworld Legends game is incredibly entertaining to play with beautiful graphics, and enjoyable setting, and a cast of interesting characters. If you’re looking for entertaining games to pass the time, the Otherworld Legends games are an excellent choice.</p><p><strong>Bonus:</strong> you wanna record your gameplay and upload to YouTube?

The oppressive visuals, brutal difficulty, and extreme bleakness make the game feel so oppressive in the extreme. With its dungeons and scavenger hunts, it keeps you on the edge of your seat, looking for treasure and gold.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/darkest-dungeon.png"                      alt="darkest-dungeon"                ></p><p>It’s one thing to defeat each dungeon’s horrifying inhabitants in turn-based combat, but your party members should also be more than meat shields. Your expeditions will inevitably take a toll on your body and mind, and this is the main reason that makes Darkest Dungeon so challenging.</p><p>Your tactical instincts will be put to the test when it comes to teamwork and resource allocation. This is undoubtedly one of the best roguelikes to be found.</p><h2 id="2-Downwell-3"><a href="#2-Downwell-3" class="headerlink" title="2.Downwell"></a><strong>2.<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/360740/Downwell/" >Downwell <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>PS4, Switch, PC, iOS, Android</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 2.99.</em></p><p>Only a couple of minutes to complete each run, this roguelike takes us on an adventure on the inside. As you dive deeper into an endless well filled with dangerous creatures, you are only protected by a pair of deadly gumboots that kill enemies, slowing down your fall for a moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/downwell.png"                      alt="downwell"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993647">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993647.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993647">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993647.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993647%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993647/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Don’t let its retro look fool you. This 2015 title is fast and intense, with a good amount of power-ups that boost your survivability. It is immediately enjoyable with its fast-paced downward action, but gaining mastery of its combat is no simple feat. Downwell is one of the best roguelikes out there, despite its intense difficulty. Its concise levels, satisfying combo system, and creative boss are among the roguelikes’ best features.</p><h2 id="3-Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup-3"><a href="#3-Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup"></a><strong>3. <a class="link"   href="https://crawl.develz.org/" >Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>Android, Web browser</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>Free To Play</em></p><p>The successor to the 1997’s roguelike Liney’s Dungeon Crawl, Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup is another best roguelike game. Although there is a considerable saturation in the roguelike titles these days, we had to include this classic title in the best roguelike games list because it deserves a spot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dungeon-crawl-stone-soup.png"                      alt="dungeon-crawl-stone-soup"                ></p><p>Each item, class, spell, and trait in this community-developed game has hundreds of hidden interactions that just heighten your enjoyment every time you play. Each floor increases the game’s difficulty, and as you go deeper, it becomes harder to decide whether to fight or flee.</p><h2 id="4-Hades-3"><a href="#4-Hades-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Hades"></a><strong>4. <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/" >Hades <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong>   <em>Nintendo Switch, macOS, Microsoft Windows, Macintosh operating systems</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 8.49.</em></p><p>Hades is a masterpiece when it comes to dungeon crawling and roguelike games. Your character is Hades’ son, Zagreus, trying to escape from the Underworld and make his way to Mount Olympus. Hades’ cyclical narrative is presented through its procedural runs and a compelling story and evocative cast of characters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hades.png"                      alt="hades"                ></p><p>Many blessings have been given to you by the gods of Olympus, but your quest is not an easy one. A game like this will enthrall you and entice you to keep playing until you get some better stuff for your characters. After each failure, you are resurrected in your own house, the House of Hades, where your friends and family await your following conversation. It is one of the best roguelike titles out there.</p><h2 id="5-Into-the-Breach-3"><a href="#5-Into-the-Breach-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Into the Breach"></a><strong>5. <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/590380/Into%5Fthe%5FBreach/" >Into the Breach <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>Switch, PC</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 6.99</em></p><p>This is the second title developed and published by Subset Games. Their first title was FTL: <strong><em>Faster Than Light</em></strong> in 2012. FTL could have taken this spot, but Into the Breach’s design and hidden depth make it stand out among the competition. It’s a game of turn-based tactics where your team is faced with an army of monsters known as the Vek.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/into-the-breach.png"                      alt="into-the-breach"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137224/26400" target="_top" id="2137224">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137224" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137224/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>There’s only one way to hold off their attack, and that is to enlist some giant mechs. But you’ll have to agonize over every decision if you intend to keep your team intact. The more you progress through the game’s islands, the more advanced equipment you’ll find, so you can turn the tide of war and save humankind.</p><p>This is one of the most accessible strategy games out there, and its straightforward combat won’t offend novices, but you should expect something more challenging, though rewarding, from Into the Breach.</p><h2 id="6-Slay-the-Spire-3"><a href="#6-Slay-the-Spire-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Slay the Spire"></a><strong>6. <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay%5Fthe%5FSpire/" >Slay the Spire <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>PS4, Switch, PC</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 8.49.</em></p><p>It foregoes combat mechanics solely in favor of strategy and premonition in a deck-building roguelike. You have no choice but to battle your way up the tower, which is also home to many monsters. This is an ideal entry point to the single-player card battler genre as it does away with the pre-battle faff. It’s also a surprising roguelike that blends options from your adventures to create an instantaneous action experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slay-the-spire.png"                      alt="slay-the-spire"                ></p><p>The game, released in 2017, has gained massive audience recognition thanks to its 10&#x2F;10 Steam rating and over 60,00 reviews despite its simplistic art and simplistic interface. It is considered the best deck-builder roguelike in the market, so if you haven’t tried it already, you miss out a lot.</p><h2 id="7-Crypt-of-the-Necrodancer-3"><a href="#7-Crypt-of-the-Necrodancer-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Crypt of the Necrodancer"></a><strong>7. <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/247080/Crypt%5Fof%5Fthe%5FNecroDancer/" >Crypt of the Necrodancer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, iOS, Microsoft Windows, Linux, Classic Mac OS, PlayStation Vita, Xbox One</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 14.99.</em></p><p>This rhythm-based roguelike game hits a sweet spot combining two niche genres. This game was released in 2015, featuring catchy soundtracks and groovy boss fights — a distinct title for gamers looking for a new challenge. While you’re running out of time before your next move, Crypt of the Necrodancer will have you tapping your foot and dripping with sweat as you keep ongoing.</p><p>This game deviates from roguelike conventions, forcing players to arrive at snappy judgments quickly. While quick decision-making and foresight are required in the genre, the escalating rhythm forces players to maintain a higher tempo to maintain a strong combo, and all you know is, you can’t lose the combo. If you haven’t tried this game yet, then it’s worth your time and money.</p><h2 id="8-Dead-Cells-3"><a href="#8-Dead-Cells-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Dead Cells"></a><strong>8. <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead%5FCells/" >Dead Cells <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>Platforms: PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, iOS, Android</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 8.49.</em></p><p>Dead Cells is a 2D and Souls-inspired roguelike game. You revolve around procedurally generated dungeon exploration in search of blueprints for better gear. The dungeon hosts a multitude of tough-as-nails enemies, which make finding these schematics no easy task.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deadcells-poster.png"                      alt="deadcells-poster"                ></p><p>Various upgrades can be carried over between runs, generating a constant sense of progression. Because of this, starting a new run after a particularly messy boss fight doesn’t sting quite as much as many other roguelike games might be. There are many different weapon types and perks to unlock in Dead Cells, making it more replayable and keeps it from being monotonous.</p><h2 id="9-The-Binding-of-Isaac-3"><a href="#9-The-Binding-of-Isaac-3" class="headerlink" title="9. The Binding of Isaac"></a><strong>9. <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/The%5FBinding%5Fof%5FIsaac/" >The Binding of Isaac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, 3DS, iOS</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>US$ 2.99.</em></p><p>An indie roguelike developed by Super Meat Boy creator Edmund McMillen, The Binding of Isaac is an action-packed adventure game. With its action-adventure elements fused with shooters, the game is an outright sick action-adventure with an acquired taste that has become cult.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-binding-of-isaac.png"                      alt="binding-of-issac"                ></p><p>In addition to some captivating gameplay, the game contains some compelling storytelling, with Biblical references providing a nice hint of lore. Although decisions are essential in roguelikes, you may also need to be quick with your reaction times with some bullet hell-style bosses.</p><h2 id="10-Otherworld-Legends-3"><a href="#10-Otherworld-Legends-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Otherworld Legends"></a><strong>10. <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chillyroom.zhmr.gp&hl=en&gl=US" >Otherworld Legends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><em>Platforms:</em></strong> <em>Android, iOS</em></p><p><strong><em>Price:</em></strong> <em>Free</em></p><p>Otherworld Legends is a mystery roguelite where you explore a mysterious and dangerous realm while discovering the mystery hidden within it. This requires equal measures of skill and perseverance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-other-world-legends.png"                      alt="the-other-world-legends"                ></p><p>As you journey through various dungeon rooms in this game, you defeat all enemies you encounter. This is similar to the binding of Isaac series of games and Elemental Dungeon. Some relics are also found or bought from time to time. These items give you powerful advantages in combat, which can be the difference between victory and defeat.</p><p>The main character of this game is Quan Huying, but there are several other characters you can choose from. You need to buy additional characters, though. They differ in cost, and some are $1.99 while others can be upwards of $2.99. It’s not expensive for me, but that doesn’t mean it’s necessarily ideal.</p><p>The Otherworld Legends game is incredibly entertaining to play with beautiful graphics, and enjoyable setting, and a cast of interesting characters. If you’re looking for entertaining games to pass the time, the Otherworld Legends games are an excellent choice.</p><p><strong>Bonus:</strong> you wanna record your gameplay and upload to YouTube?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Overcoming-OBS-Fullscreen-Issues"><a href="#Overcoming-OBS-Fullscreen-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Overcoming OBS Fullscreen Issues"></a>Overcoming OBS Fullscreen Issues</h2><p>OBS Studio is the most popular free video recording and streaming software. However, there are certain OBS issues that are often reported on different forums. OBS Studio not recording full screen is a common complaint. There are many who have reported that OBS is capturing Windowed screen but as soon as they are switching to Full screen recording, OBS fails miserably and captures only a black screen instead. There could be various reasons behind OBS full screen not working.</p><p>First of all, OBS Studio files could have got corrupted somehow. Sometimes, OBS Studio is heavily using CPU resources in capturing full screen, and hence, due to very fast access, CPU has limited the access of usage. There are could be a compatibility issue with OBS Studio and your Windows version. Sometimes, any third-party screen recording software could intervene in OBS operation. In this article, we will illustrate all the possible ways to fix OBS does not recording full screen issue.</p><h2 id="Way-1-Modify-CPU-Setting-for-OBS"><a href="#Way-1-Modify-CPU-Setting-for-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Modify CPU Setting for OBS"></a>Way 1. Modify CPU Setting for OBS</h2><p>By default, OBS CPU usage present is set to very fast. This means the encoder is running very fast which leads to less CPU time usage. The higher the present, the less is the CPU usage. Unless you have a high-end computer, this default setting can lead to rendering and encoding issues. OBS uses more CPU resources when you are recording full screen. CPU tends to limit its allocation for OBS when OBS starts using CPU resources at a very fast speed. This leads to OBS not full screen recording issue. You should change the setting by taking the following steps.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS Studio and go to Controls tab.</p><p>Step 2: Click on Settings button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-click-on-settings-button.jpg"                      alt="obs click on settings button"                ></p><p>Step 3: Go to Output tab and change Output Mode from Simple to Advanced.</p><p>Step 4: Change CPU Usage Present from Veryfast to Ultrafast so that OBS uses less CPU resources for the encoding process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-change-cpu-usage.jpg"                      alt="obs change cpu usage"                ></p><p>Step 5: Click on Apply and Ok button.</p><h2 id="Way-2-Shut-Down-The-Game-Bar-Recording"><a href="#Way-2-Shut-Down-The-Game-Bar-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Shut Down The Game Bar Recording"></a>Way 2. Shut Down The Game Bar Recording</h2><p>There are certain gaming features available in Windows 10 that cause rendering issue for OBS studio. If game mode is on, all the GPU resources are used in the active game and hence, OBS suffers in performance. Similarly, if Game Bar recording is on, it interferes with OBS Studio full screen recording and leads to OBS studio not recording full screen game. You need to turn off Game Bar recording by taking the following steps.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Start menu and open Settings app.</p><p>Step 2: From Setting, open Gaming option.</p><p>Step 3: Go to Xbox Game Bar tab on the left side.</p><p>4: Turn it off so that it does not record your gameplay.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-settings-xbox-game-bar.jpg"                      alt="windows settings xbox game bar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2112008/7443" target="_top" id="2112008">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2112008" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2112008/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Way-3-Empower-the-Compatibility-Mode"><a href="#Way-3-Empower-the-Compatibility-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Way 3. Empower the Compatibility Mode"></a>Way 3. Empower the Compatibility Mode</h2><p>One of the common reasons why OBS does not recording full screen is due to compatibility issue with the operating system. That is why there is an option available in Windows to run any application in compatible mode with lower Windows version. You can do the same for OBS Studio and there are many users who have reported the issue of full screen recording getting solved when they changed the compatibility mode to Windows 8. Here are the steps you have to take.</p><p>Step 1: Launch OBS Studio on your computer.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Start menu and open Task Manager.</p><p>Step 3: On Task manager, find OBS Studio under Apps. Right-click on it and select Properties.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-task-manager-properties.jpg"                      alt="windows task manager properties"                ></p><p>Step 4: From Properties, copy the file location.

Turn Your Gameplay to Windowed Mode</h2><p>When OBS Studio not recording full screen game, you have to move to Windowed Mode momentarily to ensure OBS Studio is actually capturing the gameplay or not. After capturing your gameplay in Windowed mode, you can switch to Full Screen Mode and check if the problem is solved. This helps as the default settings get reset and any issue with the settings causing the problem gets resolved. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Move your game from full screen mode to windowed mode. You need to check the Settings of your game and bring out the resolution and screen dimensions so that it moves to Windowed Mode from full screen settings.</p><p>Step 2: Open OBS Studio and from Sources, click on “+” icon and select Display Capture.</p><p>Step 3: Right-click on Display Capture and click on Windowed Projector option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/turn-your-gameplay-to-windows-mode.jpg"                      alt="turn your gameplay to windows mode"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082520/7443" target="_top" id="2082520">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082520" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082520/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 4: Click on Start Recording and move to your Windowed game screen.

It gives you a trial that limits what you can do, but gives you enough of a taste of the app so that you understand it. With this, you can start to learn how it works. It is not that complicated so this part should not take long. It works and it offers what it promises. The only downside is that it will cost you money. If you are looking for something free or cheap, this is not what you want. The developers are aiming for the professionals that want to spend money.</p><p>Overall, it is okay. The cost may not make it worth it for many users on the market.</p><h4 id="4-Ember"><a href="#4-Ember" class="headerlink" title="4.

With it, you can take all of the screenshots that you want to take. Whether you are making a scrapbook or this is for professional purposes, this app is available to use. You can organize all of the screenshots, too. Unlike UX Recorder, there is no cost involved. Simply start taking photos of your screen immediately. You can share them, organize them, and use them as you please. They are your screenshots and images, after all. There is nothing to it.</p><p>Overall, this is a great option if you only want images. The downside is that it is not actually a screen recorder, which means no videos involved.</p><h4 id="5-Screenpresso"><a href="#5-Screenpresso" class="headerlink" title="5.

Like Ember, it focuses more on images, though you can use it for videos, too. Unlike Ember, it also focuses heavily on editing. It is for professionals. It wants to help you get all of your images and videos sorted and ready to use. This is for all professional purposes, including manuals. If there is a project that you need to do for your job, and it requires images or video, it is likely that this program can help you to manage it. It also makes it easy to import and export all images and videos.</p><p>Overall, this is a helpful tool for professionals.
