We have stated all the key features that make the recorder stand out. You are also aware of the plans of the screen recorder and we have recommended a better alternative which is Wondershare Filmora where you get better features and functionalities for perfect recording and editing.</p><p>Hence, the free version of Screencast-O-Matic is more like a demo version. You need to have the premium version to record video without any recording limitation and any watermark. Here are the plans and prices you can choose from.</p><p>1. Solo Deluxe - $4.00 per month: You get all the features of the screen recorder without any limitation. But you get limited stock library.</p><p>2. Solo Premier - $5.75 per month: You get all features without any limitation. Additionally, you get unlimited stock library, online video backup, video hosting, and privacy controls. You can also include call-to-action option in the video along with annotation. Besides, there is an option for video branding and custom video player.</p><p>3. Business Team - $5 per month for 3 users: You get all the features on Solo Deluxe and Premier.

You always need an active internet connection to record your screen. The file format for saving the video is limited to MP4 only. The useful editing options are still limited in comparison to a professional video editor. That is why there are many who look for a better alternative to Screencast-O-Matic screen recorder. We recommend Wondershare Filmora which is a premium <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with inbuilt video editor.</p><p>In comparison to Screencast-O-Matic, Filmora has more options for better screen and webcam recording. It lets you save the recorded video in different file formats. You get more customizable settings and configurations, and the video editor is far better than what you get on Screencast-O-Matic.

Best Alternative to Active Presenter"></a>Part 4. Best Alternative to Active Presenter</h2><p>Active Presenter’s focus lies in creating software simulations, demos, and interactive slides rather than being a dedicated screen recorder of what most users expect. It’s pricing is high and its learning curve can be demanding. Furthermore, the video import option is limited. Therefore, we suggest Wondershare Filmora as an alternative to Active Presenter 8.</p><p>Filmora is a dedicated <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with an advanced video editing platform.

The Streamlabs OBS helps you keep track of your donations and fans. With pre-made themes and templates, it is also easier to incorporate them in a live stream. Non-Streamlabs versions of OBS still support OBS templates, themes, and overlays. But due to its lacking of various features, there’s an alternative to it namely Wondershare Filmora.

You can use them on virtually every major streaming platform, from Twitch to YouTube to Facebook Gaming and everywhere else. You can create your streaming templates if you are a skilled designer and have access to appropriate graphics software, such as Adobe Photoshop or Fireworks. But for that, we have got a recommendation as mentioned earlier – Filmora solution. It’s an all-inclusive software with the best options available as an alternative to Streamlabs.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-adept-approaches-for-capturing-high-impact-presentations/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Adept Approaches for Capturing High-Impact Presentations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-remove-background-noise-from-skype-video-calls/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  How to Remove Background Noise From Skype Video Calls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-chromebooks-ultimate-sniping-software-our-5-favorites/"><u>[New] Chromebook's Ultimate Sniping Software  Our 5 Favorites</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-cutting-edge-communication-strategies-merging-slack-with-filmoras-capabilities/"><u>[New] Cutting-Edge Communication Strategies  Merging Slack with Filmora's Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-efficient-editing-for-creators-top-10-online-trimmers-for-2024/"><u>[New] Efficient Editing for Creators - Top 10 Online Trimmers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-examining-splitcams-video-quality-against-competitors-for-2024/"><u>[New] Examining SplitCam's Video Quality Against Competitors for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-explore-10-open-source-teleconference-applications/"><u>[New] Explore 10 Open Source Teleconference Applications</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-best-approaches-to-non-sound-media/"><u>[New] In 2024, Best Approaches to Non-Sound Media</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-leading-rogue-adventures-10-game-compilation/"><u>[New] In 2024, Leading Rogue Adventures  #10 Game Compilation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-transform-your-presence-on-facebook-through-live-broadcasting/"><u>[New] In 2024, Transform Your Presence on Facebook Through Live Broadcasting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-maximize-learning-mac-methods-to-document-lectures/"><u>[New] Maximize Learning  Mac Methods to Document Lectures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-transform-dull-game-captures-into-bright-shows-with-obs-tricks/"><u>[New] Transform Dull Game Captures Into Bright Shows with OBS Tricks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-clearview-screenshot-perfect-windowsmac-imaging/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  ClearView Screenshot  Perfect Windows/Mac Imaging</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-explosive-entertainment-for-little-ones/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Explosive Entertainment for Little Ones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-enlightening-path-to-capturing-your-mac-screens/"><u>[Updated] Enlightening Path to Capturing Your Mac Screens</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-mute-people-on-google-meet-video-call/"><u>[Updated] How to Mute People on Google Meet Video Call</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-become-a-wizard-elevating-the-art-of-ppt-to-video-conversion/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Become a Wizard  Elevating the Art of PPT to Video Conversion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-breaking-down-the-finest-liquid-simulation-games/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Breaking Down the Finest Liquid Simulation Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-live-streaming-showdown-streamlabs-vs-obs-face-off/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Live Streaming Showdown  Streamlabs Vs.

In addition, most of these platforms grant you access to various collaboration tools that make the participants in a meeting more productive.</p><p><strong>Screen sharing</strong> is undoubtedly one of the most useful collaboration tools video conferencing services can offer, as it allows the users to share a live feed of their computer screens with all other attendees of a web conference. This, in turn, enables the swift flow of information between all participants in a video conference and it gives them immediate insight into everything that is happening on a shared screen.</p><p>We’ve done some researches and find out some video conferencing services that offers screen sharing. In this article we are going to take you through the ten best options you can use free of charge.</p><h2 id="The-Ten-Best-Video-Conferencing-Software-That-Provide-Screen-Sharing-Options"><a href="#The-Ten-Best-Video-Conferencing-Software-That-Provide-Screen-Sharing-Options" class="headerlink" title="The Ten Best Video Conferencing Software That Provide Screen Sharing Options"></a>The Ten Best Video Conferencing Software That Provide Screen Sharing Options</h2><p>Even though each video conferencing software we included in this article can be used for free, some of the services offer only a limited set of options on their free versions. This means that the number of participants or the maximum duration of a group meeting can be restricted.</p><p>Purchasing a subscription plan is your only option if you want to be able to use all tools these video conferencing services have to offer. Here are the ten best video conferencing software products that provide screen sharing features.</p><h3 id="1-GoToMeeting"><a href="#1-GoToMeeting" class="headerlink" title="1.

You can use this app directly from your web-browser, on your Smartphone or Macs and PCs. The free version of GoToMeeting includes the screen sharing feature and it provides webcam support.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gotomeeting-screen-sharing.jpg"                      alt=" GoToMeeting Screen Sharing options"                ></p><p>Sharing a screen with GoToMeeting is a simple process that can be completed in just a few easy steps regardless of the device you’re using. However, if you opt for the free version of this video conferencing service you won’t be able to host meetings that have more than three participants. Furthermore, the maximum duration of a group meeting is limited to just forty minutes which makes the free version of GoToMeeting a good option just for individuals and small businesses. If you want to have access to unlimited cloud recording, automatic transcription or keyboard and mouse sharing options you will have to purchase the Business or Enterprise subscription model.</p><h3 id="2-Zoom"><a href="#2-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="2.

Moreover, the platform doesn’t limit the number of meetings you can host, although hosting meetings that are longer than forty minutes is not possible on the free version of Zoom.</p><p>As a host of a Zoom meeting, you can enable one or more participants to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >share screens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> simultaneously.

What’s more, you can host an unlimited number of meetings that can last for as long as you want, because there are no restrictions regarding the maximum duration of a meeting. The screen sharing feature is available even on the Cisco Webex mobile app so that you can share your device’s screen even if you are attending a meeting from you phone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4615471&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/affiliate-image/affiliate_banners_en/max_782x90.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Skype"><a href="#4-Skype" class="headerlink" title="4.

Besides offering video chat and messaging tools, Skype also allows you to organize conference calls with up to fifty participants. All you need to do in order to create a conference call on Skype is to generate a call link with a single click and then share the invitations with the participants who can join the call via the unique link you send to them.</p><p>Each participant in a conference call can share their screen at any point in the meeting which makes the collaboration between different team members easier. You can record all your conference calls and Skype is going to store them for an entire month before deleting them. However, Skype offers fewer options than most video conferencing services, since you can’t schedule meetings in advance, create private rooms or adjust the meeting’s settings.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940317&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Apache-OpenMeetings"><a href="#5-Apache-OpenMeetings" class="headerlink" title="5.

The maximum number of participants in a meeting depends on the type of meeting you select since you can create conference rooms with up to 32 participants, webinars with up to a hundred attendees or interviews that can’t include more than two persons.</p><p>It is hardly surprising that Apache OpenMeetings allows its users to share screens during video calls because the software is stacked with features that can potentially make the collaboration between team members more productive. In addition, you can record all video conferences you organize with this software, although you can only store footage on your local hard drive. Apache OpenMeetings is far from easy to use, and you are going to need some coding experience in order to optimize the software in accordance with your needs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a class="link"   href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4729642&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1" >Advanced Find and Replace for Google Sheets, Lifetime subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Join-Me"><a href="#6-Join-Me" class="headerlink" title="6.

Currently, you can only host a meeting on Join.Me if you purchase a monthly subscription, but participants don’t have to pay a fee in order to attend a meeting.</p><p>In case you opt for the least expensive Lite subscription model you will be able to host meetings that have up to five participants, although the webcam streaming option is not going to be available. The screen and window sharing feature is available within all subscription models, which means that you can use this collaboration tool regardless of the pricing plan you choose. None of the subscription models offered by Join.Me limits the maximum number of meetings you can have in one month or their duration. However, if you want to get access to recording features or store your videos online you will have to opt for the Pro or Business subscription plan.</p><h3 id="7-Google-Hangouts"><a href="#7-Google-Hangouts" class="headerlink" title="7.

Although Google Hangouts isn’t necessarily the first option that comes to mind when video conferencing platforms are mentioned, the app is still a reliable choice for anyone who wants to host a video meeting.</p><p>What’s more Google Hangouts is equipped with screen sharing features which makes it a perfect collaboration tool for small and medium-sized teams. The best part is that like most of Google’s apps, Google Hangouts is completely free. However, the app is not without limitations, so you shouldn’t expect to find any advanced video conferencing options offered by Zoom or GoToMeeting. Even so, Google Hangouts offers a quick solution if you want to host an online meeting without having to go through the software installation process.</p><h3 id="8-TeamViewer"><a href="#8-TeamViewer" class="headerlink" title="8. TeamViewer"></a>8. <a class="link"   href="https://www.teamviewer.com/en/products/teamviewer/" >TeamViewer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, pricing plans start at $33.00 per month</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, Android, iOS</p><p>Although TeamViewer isn’t a video conferencing software, it is one of the best options you’ll have if you want to access different devices remotely. It is commonly used by customer support teams to provide assistance to users who are experiencing difficulties with a software product, but you can also use it to transfer large files, print documents remotely or install applications on a Smartphone or a computer.</p><p>Furthermore, you can install <a class="link"   href="https://www.blizz.com/en/" >Blizz TeamViewer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to schedule meetings that have up to 300 participants, record your meetings or enable members of your team to share their screens during meetings. The platform enables you to set up a meeting with a single click, while it also offers the HD VoIP option that allows you to reach your clients and colleagues wherever they are. Even though TeamViewer and Blizz TeamViewer can be downloaded for free, you must purchase a subscription plan in order to use all of the features they have to offer.</p><h3 id="9-FreeConference"><a href="#9-FreeConference" class="headerlink" title="9. FreeConference"></a>9. <a class="link"   href="https://www.freeconference.com/" >FreeConference <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, pricing plans start at $9.99 per month</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS</p><p>Besides video conferencing tools, this software also offers free conference calls, you just have to pick a free dial-in number or even choose a dedicated dial-in number. Setting up a video conference is an intuitive process that won’t take more than a few moments of your time.</p><p>However, the free version of FreeConference doesn’t allow you to host meetings that have more than five participants. Each participant can share their screen easily regardless of the pricing plan you have, while they can also communicate via chat throughout the meeting. Conference calls that are not hosted over the Internet can have up to a hundred participants and you can have an unlimited number of calls if you are calling local numbers. Online whiteboard, document sharing or SMS entry are also the options you’re going to have at your disposal if you choose the free version of the FreeConference software. Keep in mind that audio and video recording options are not going to be available unless you purchase a conferencing plan.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://vapordna.pxf.io/c/5597632/1496243/17238" target="_top" id="1496243"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17238-1496243"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1221"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1496243/17238"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="10-Lifesize-Video-Conferencing"><a href="#10-Lifesize-Video-Conferencing" class="headerlink" title="10.

The maximum number of participants is limited to 25, although you can host up to 300 participants if you purchase one of the available subscription plans.</p><p>Unlike other video conferencing services that provide HD video quality, Lifesize Video Conferencing offers support for 4K video meetings, although this option is only available within Plus and Enterprise pricing plans. Unsurprisingly, sharing a screen during a meeting is remarkably easy as you just have to click on the Present button and decide if you want to share the entire screen or just an application window. Recording a meeting is not possible with the free version of the software, while the scheduling options leave much to be desired regardless of the pricing model.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>A simple feature like screen sharing can make a world of difference for your team’s productivity, as it enables the participants in a meeting to present their ideas or collaborate on a document effortlessly. This feature is included in the free version of most video conferencing software products you can find on the market, which means that the participants of the meetings you host are going to be able to share their screens even if you don’t purchase a subscription plan. Which free video conferencing service that offers screen sharing features are you going to choose?

Unlike other media players, QuickTime Player is not just for playing audio and video files. The application can record the screen on Mac and save the recordings on the hard drive. Therefore, there is no need for any third-party screen recorder for basic recording. However, many users have reported that they <strong>cannot stop QuickTime screen recording</strong> following the standard procedure.</p><p>When the application fails to stop recording, it fails to save the recording as well. Therefore, QuickTime Player keeps recording the screen, and this slows down the Mac as it keeps occupying the system resources. In this article, we will illustrate all the possible ways to QuickTime Player stop screen recording. We will also recommend a better alternative to QuickTime for professional-quality screen recording.</p><h5 id="Filmora-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#Filmora-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Filmora Screen Recorder"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h5><p>Record computer screen and webcam</p><p>Capture system and microphone audio</p><p>Customize the target recording area</p><p>Edit videos with thousands of effects and tools</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="1-Direct-Way-to-Stop-QuickTime-Recording"><a href="#1-Direct-Way-to-Stop-QuickTime-Recording" class="headerlink" title="1.

Zoom allows its users to purchase webinar add-ons that can have as many as 149 hosts and 10,000 attendees. Each of the plans enables the host or hosts to have an unlimited number of meetings, which means that you can run as many webinars as you want with Zoom.</p><p>The platform doesn’t allow its users to host webinars for free and you must purchase a monthly or the annual subscription if you would like to host your webinars on Zoom. You can choose from Pro, Business, Education and Zoom Room options and the exact cost of the subscription depends on the maximum number of hosts and participants a webinar can have, so, for instance, you will have to pay around $50 per month if your webinar plan has just one host and a hundred participants.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-webinar-on-zoom-pricing.jpg"                      alt="Add Webinar to Zoom Plan"                ></p><p>Furthermore, each of the available plans offers the cloud recording option, and you can get up to 3 TB of extra storage for an additional fee. Once you purchase a license you will also have to assign it to the owner of the Zoom account or the admin of a particular account. You can do this by heading over to the User Management menu and selecting the Users option. After you locate the user to which you would like to assign a webinar license, you should click on the Edit button at the end of the user’s row and click on the Webinar option in the Feature menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-webinar-setting-editing.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Webinar Setting Editing"                ></p><p>Optionally, you can choose the user’s role, specify their job title or add their location. When done, you should click on the Save button to confirm the changes you’ve made and proceed with the setup of your webinar.</p><p>Looking for some other webinar software?

Simply sign in to the webinar portal, click on the Webinars option and then click on the Schedule a Webinar button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/schedule-zoom-webinar.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Schedule Webinar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12730965&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://incomedia.eu/files/images/affiliates/w5/03_WBSX5_728x90_red_CTA.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>You can then provide the information about the topic of the webinar, write a short description of the webinar that is going to be displayed at the registration page, set the time and date when the webinar is supposed to take place and specify how long the webinar is going to last.</p><p>Furthermore, you can choose to set up a one time or a recurring webinar, and in case you opt for a recurring type of webinar you can choose if the webinar will take place daily, weekly or monthly. Keep in mind that a single webinar cannot occur more than fifty sessions.</p><p>In addition, you can adjust the registration settings, audio options, set up a webinar password, enable practice sessions or opt to record the webinar automatically.</p><p>Zoom also enables you to add templates to the webinar you’re scheduling, pick the webinar’s time zone or use Q&amp;A panels during throughout the webinar. The webinar’s host can allow only signed-in users to join the webinar or make the webinar on-demand. However, only webinars that require registration can be turned into on-demand webinars, and by enabling this option you will automatically activate the cloud recording feature.</p><p>Hosts can choose to turn off their video streams while setting up a new webinar, but video streams can be switched on at any point during a webinar. Moreover, you can choose if you want to switch the participants’ videos on or off, although you should only use this option if you are sure that you won’t be needing attendees’ videos throughout the webinar.</p><p>Click on the Schedule button when done adjusting the webinar settings and proceed to send invitations to panelists or attendees.</p><p>Panelists have a different status than attendees since they can view and send videos, share their screens or add annotations. Attendees, on the other hand, can only view the webinar, but the host can unmute them or change their view of the webinar. In most cases, attendees interact with a webinar through Q&amp;A panels and chat.</p><p>The process of inviting panelists to a webinar is straightforward since you just have to go to the Invitations tab and click on the Edit button in the Panelists section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/invite-people-to-zoom-webinar.jpg"                      alt="Invite people to Zoom Webinar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40002580&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/3_Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF 2-Year Plan</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Zoom allows you to invite up to a hundred panelists to a webinar, and you just have to add their names and emails to the corresponding boxes and click on the checkbox next to the Send invitation to all newly added panelists immediately option.</p><p>Click on the Save button to send invitations to panelists.

The webinar is a paid add-on that is available on Pro, Business and other Zoom’s subscription models. The meeting feature, on the other hand, is available on free and all other versions of the Zoom platform.</p><p>Furthermore, all participants in a Zoom meeting can share their screens, see other participants or speak to them. Webinar attendees, cannot share their screens, use annotations or any other options provided by the platform, as their interaction capabilities are reduced to chat and participation in Q&amp;A panels. In addition, the host of a webinar can choose whether or not he or she wants to see the video of each attendee, while all attendees join webinars in a listen-only mode.</p><p>A webinar can have up to 10,000 participants, while meeting cannot have more than a thousand participants. Furthermore, Zoom meetings are primarily used for business purposes like sales or customer-facing meetings. Education is the most common reason for creating a webinar, and unlike meetings, Zoom webinars can have up to fifty sessions. Consequently, the list of features Zoom meetings and Zoom webinars offer are slightly different.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Anyone can set up a new webinar with Zoom, even if they have no previous experience. However, knowing how long each session of the webinar is going to last or how much time should pass between two webinar sessions is going to help you adjust the settings of your webinar more precisely.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Real-Story-Exploring-RecordCast-Features"><a href="#The-Real-Story-Exploring-RecordCast-Features" class="headerlink" title="The Real Story: Exploring RecordCast Features"></a>The Real Story: Exploring RecordCast Features</h2><p>You would have probably needed the recording of the screen of your laptop, for that there are a plethora of options available on the internet. You may use them to produce comprehensive recordings as well as recordings that are limited to a single component or window. The disadvantage is that the free versions of this software sometimes include some very inconvenient restrictions, such as a relatively short time usage or bearing of those annoying presence of watermarks, which might negatively affect the result somewhat.</p><p>We introduce you to an amazing recording software RecordCast by PearlMountain company to record your screen and webcams online. It is a web-based application designed to capture your screen, webcam, and microphone input data. The interface to use the application is very user-friendly. Moreover, it provides free usage capability of up to 5 minutes of maximum recording time. However, for longer recordings, you might need to upgrade them. Let’s have a detailed review of the RecordCast in the coming sections.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Key-Features-of-RecordCast"><a href="#Part-1-Key-Features-of-RecordCast" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Key Features of RecordCast"></a>Part 1: Key Features of RecordCast</h2><p>Software is best analyzed by the features it has to offer. The RecordCast is equipped with amazing features that you can avail of directly online through the web. Let’s discuss these features one by one to explore them for your ease.</p><p>**<strong>Free and User-Friendly</strong></p><p>The first and the foremost prevalent perk of a RecordCast is its free usage for its users. The application provides you to sign in free of cost to avail of its recording capabilities without any watermark issues. Moreover, the GUI of the web-based application is very easy to use that only needs a few steps to do the job.</p><p>**<strong>Multiple Recording Modes:</strong></p><p>With the 3 recording modes of the RecordCast, it leads all other similar software which usually has single recording modes. The three recording modes let you choose to record webcam + screen simultaneously or one at a time.</p><p>**<strong>All-in-One:</strong></p><p>The RecordCast is not only designed to record screens but with its video editing tools, you can now edit, trim, change colors, apply filters and put artistic effects on any video online. This amazing feature makes it a competitor for video editor tools too.</p><p>**<strong>Protected:</strong></p><p>With great care for privacy and security, RecordCast stores and edit your video or recordings locally. It doesn’t upload your content to the web servers instead, it never shares your content with any third party.</p><p>**<strong>Fair Pricing:</strong></p><p>The free version of RecordCast let you record a screen or webcam for a maximum of 5 minutes. However, it can be upgraded to its premium version so you can avail all its features by only paying 2.99 $ per month. This is very fair considering other similar software pricing.</p><p>**<strong>Compatibility:</strong></p><p>Due to the online nature of the RecordCast, it is compatible with any computer.

In order to make your characters do something on the screen, you need to move your limbs, especially arms in a specific direction with exact motion so that desired job can be done. In one part of this game, players need to block the snowballs to defend his snow castle, and it can be done by moving hands in both directions. One more addition to this series is more interesting where the player needs to pop the green bubbles available on the screen while saving the red ones.</p><p>You will love the graphics, background music and animations of this game. But note that its ability to sense your limb movements completely depends on the webcam quality. The great news for crazy gamers is that it is a two-player game where his player can have his personal paddle on one portion of the screen.</p><h4 id="2-OvO-Game"><a href="#2-OvO-Game" class="headerlink" title="2.

But you will love the way it adds few unique games in between and allow players to do experiments with advanced photo editing effects and filters. It plays 11 different games in series, and you can control them by simply moving your limbs including head, legs, and arms.</p><p>People love the way developers have merged 3D modeling with this gaming platform while supporting awesome display features. But the sad part is that it does not support full-screen option, and the camera capture ability still needs some improvements. The best idea is to spend some time with its trial version; buy the package only if you like the stuff.</p><h4 id="3-Pizza-King"><a href="#3-Pizza-King" class="headerlink" title="3.

The Editor’s Review</h2><p>Now, it is time to give you our final verdict and leave no gap between the lips and the cup.</p><p>Performance: The performance of the application is smooth and flawless. Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording. However, it does take up system resources, and for an old PC, the effect could be significant. But for a modern PC, there is no issue. Therefore, it scores really well as far as performance is concerned.</p><p>Functions: As a standalone screen recorder, the app is perfect from all aspects. Starting from recording full screen and custom screen to recording with and without cursor, all standard features and some advanced features are available. You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.</p><p>Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder. All in all, if you want professional video quality, you have to look for alternatives.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068407/7443" target="_top" id="2068407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068407"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-2"><a href="#Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

The Editor’s Review"></a>Part 3. The Editor’s Review</h2><p>Now, it is time to give you our final verdict and leave no gap between the lips and the cup.</p><p>Performance: The performance of the application is smooth and flawless. Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording. However, it does take up system resources, and for an old PC, the effect could be significant. But for a modern PC, there is no issue. Therefore, it scores really well as far as performance is concerned.</p><p>Functions: As a standalone screen recorder, the app is perfect from all aspects. Starting from recording full screen and custom screen to recording with and without cursor, all standard features and some advanced features are available. You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.</p><p>Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder. All in all, if you want professional video quality, you have to look for alternatives.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BSQL%2BRecovery"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/sql-recovery.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-3"><a href="#Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Top-5-PS1-Emulation-Software-on-Modern-Computers"><a href="#Top-5-PS1-Emulation-Software-on-Modern-Computers" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 PS1 Emulation Software on Modern Computers"></a>Top 5 PS1 Emulation Software on Modern Computers</h2><p>Sony released its first standalone console for video games, Playstation1 (nicknamed PS1), in 2001. The PlayStation 2 was released to compete with Nintendo’s SNES, which ruled the console video-gaming market for years. Sony launched its first-ever gaming console after years of reorganizations and partnerships, including ones with Nintendo. The console was immensely successful until its successor replaced it.</p><p>With the PS1 emulator for PC, you can play PlayStation 1 games. Play your favorite PlayStation games on your computer with the original BIOS, your own BIOS, and your own games. Listed below, you will find some of the best PS1 emulators that will allow you to relive those days. If you have an original game disk, even better. All you need is a copy of the disc image.</p><h3 id="1-RetroArch-Emulator"><a href="#1-RetroArch-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="1.RetroArch Emulator"></a>1.RetroArch Emulator</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/retroarch-emulator-ps1.png"                      alt="retroarch-emulator-ps1"                ></p><p>This emulator offers a variety of solutions and is just an emulator for playing PS1 video games, making it one of the best ps 1 emulators and most complete emulators. The first stable version was released in the year 2020, almost a decade after its launch in the year 2010. On top of all that, it is free, open-source, and can emulate gaming consoles, media players, game engines, and others. That makes it a very reliable emulator.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Multiple platforms are supported, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.</li><li>As a fast, portable, lightweight emulator, RetroArch requires no adjustments or very little tweaking to run and function properly.</li><li>In terms of game-saving, refresh rate, game loading, and screen resolution, it is one of the best PS1 emulators out there.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Matsu-Emulator"><a href="#2-Matsu-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="2.Matsu Emulator"></a>2.Matsu Emulator</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/matsu-emulator-ps1.png"                      alt="matsu-emulator-ps1"                ></p><p>There is also the Matsu Emulator, which is based on the PSX&#x2F;PSOne platform. Despite being one of the best emulators in the world, it is also quite stable and safe. There are more and more features being added to the software. In contrast, the simulator works well but the free version has heavy advertising. If you purchase the pro edition in the game, you will be able to remove the advertisements. If you would like to pay someone for an emulator, we would recommend ePSXe or FPse. You will find Matsu Emulator to be a reliable and efficient program if you can endure its commercials.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>It features an on-screen virtual keypad as well as support for gamepads.</li><li>The sound quality is excellent.</li><li>As well as fast-forwarding, it also supports rewinding.</li><li>Up to 16 slots can be used by the Matsu emulator.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Mednafen"><a href="#3-Mednafen" class="headerlink" title="3.Mednafen"></a>3.Mednafen</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mednafen-poster-ps1.png"                      alt="mednafen-poster-ps1"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.macxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4526659&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.macxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/vcp-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Games are run using OpenGL and SDL in Mednafen, a multi-system emulator. Users can remap hotkeys and virtual system inputs to joysticks or keyboards, or both simultaneously. Rewinding in real-time and saving at multiple states are supported by the emulator. It also allows you to take screenshots instantly. Pictures are saved as PNG files.</p><p>The majority of Mednafen’s cores are portions from other applications, but some are originals. In terms of quality, precision, and compatibility, its original cores (built to run PS1, Sega Saturn, and Nintendo Virtual Boy games) are noteworthy. The command-line interface of Mednafen is easy to use. Additionally, it supports several third-party GUIs to make configuration even easier.

A wide range of devices are supported, making it a fast, accurate, and highly versatile tool. Within seconds, you can start playing games after configuring the program. It is just a matter of copying the BIOS file from your console, setting up the controller, and customizing the keys.</p><p>Gameplay usually runs smoothly without much configuration and trial-and-error. When your game doesn’t load or you experience lags, you can fix it by applying an ePSXe patch (in .ppf format).</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>This software provides a close analogous experience to playing video games on the PlayStation One itself, but on a personal computer.</li><li>Its controller options can be tailored to meet your needs.</li><li>It allows you to pause, resume, and save your gameplay from the point you last left it.</li><li>Dual-player and split-screen modes are available.
