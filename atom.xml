A layer can be described as any type of image, moving or still, that is superimposed over a background image. However, just adding one layer over another will not create a strong visual impact on the spectator, which is why using Blending Modes is recommended if you want to <strong>blend two overlaying videos or images</strong> seamlessly.</p><p>It is a widely accepted opinion that Blend Modes can only be used in Adobe Premiere Pro or After Effects, but in this article, we are going to bust that myth and show you how to utilize Blending Modes in Filmora Scrn. Before we get started, let’s figure out what blending modes is.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                > Secure Download</p><h2 id="What-are-Blending-Modes-in-Filmora"><a href="#What-are-Blending-Modes-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="What are Blending Modes in Filmora?"></a>What are Blending Modes in Filmora?</h2><p>Combining videos or images into a single frame is an art that is much older than digital pictures, so when trying to understand Blend Modes in Filmora Scrn it is best to try to visualize two pieces of celluloid film, one over another. Two pieces of film are transparent, but the images they contain do not mix with each other, that is why when you are using Blend Modes in Filmora Scrn you are actually merging videos and allowing their pixels to mix.</p><p>Different ways of combining pixels are called modes, and for that reason, the properties of the <strong>Linear Burn mode</strong> are not the same as the properties of the <strong>Multiply blending mode</strong>. Each mode you select, brings preset image transparency as well as brightness, contrast and color values. Which mode you will use depends mostly on the context and the images you want to use in your video.</p><p>The <strong>Normal mode</strong> is a part of the standard set of blending modes in almost all photo and video editing programs. It enables you to keep the top layer intact, by preventing the pixels from two images to merge. It is a perfect PIP blending mode since it allows you to keep two overlaying images separate and have two different narratives within the same shot. Producers of YouTube videos and tutorials of any kind or gamers who want to entertain their audiences should use the Normal mode when editing their footage captured with Filmora Scrn.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-normal-mode.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Scrn Blending modes"                ></p><p>The <strong>Screen Mode</strong> is best used when you are working with dark monochrome backgrounds because it reduces the dark areas in the video thus enabling you to blend the top layer into the background seamlessly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-screen-mode.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Scrn Blending modes"                ></p><p>Utilizing this mode successfully requires previous preparation because the effects you’ll get if you use the Screen mode with a footage that is not best suited for this mode are far from impressive. Therefore, the video clips you want to overlay and blend with each other must be recorded perfectly in order to get the best results.</p><p>The <strong>Multiply Mode</strong> is also one of the frequently used blending modes that <strong>multiplies the numbers for each pixel of the overlaying video clip</strong> with a matching pixel from the background video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-multiply-mode.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Scrn Blending modes"                ></p><p>This mode will enable you to create the black background for your video effortlessly, and highlight the subjects in the video clip you intend to use as a top layer. You need to choose carefully which video clips you are going to use and how are they going to look on a dark background if you want to produce visually pleasing videos that captivate the viewer’s attention.</p><h2 id="How-to-use-Blending-Modes"><a href="#How-to-use-Blending-Modes" class="headerlink" title="How to use Blending Modes?"></a>How to use Blending Modes?</h2><p>Applying different blending modes and switching between them is easy, and it won’t take more than a few minutes of your time, once you get a hold of it. Filmora Scrn features a number of different blending modes, so figuring out what each mode can do may take some time and practice. Let’s have a look at how you can add multiple layers to your videos and how to use blending modes.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Importing-files-into-Filmora-Scrn"><a href="#Step-1-Importing-files-into-Filmora-Scrn" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 - Importing files into Filmora Scrn"></a>Step 1 - Importing files into Filmora Scrn</h4><p>In case you’ve used Filmora Scrn’s screen recorder to capture your video, the video clip will be opened in the software’s video editor and placed in the media bin, immediately after the recording session is over. However, the Wondershare’s software also allows you to import the footage you’ve captured with a video camera or any other video recording software or device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-add-files.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Scrn Import Media"                ></p><p>Click on the Add Files icon in the Media bin, and select the footage you want to use in your project. Drag the video clip you’d like to use as a background to a track on the timeline and then drag and drop the video or a photo to a timeline above the one on which the background clip is located.</p><p>Adjust the duration of the video clips or photos you’ve placed on the timeline and use the preview window to determine whether or not you should readjust the size and position of the overlaying image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-blending-mode-tracks.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Scrn Blending modes"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Select-the-Blending-mode"><a href="#Step-2-Select-the-Blending-mode" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 - Select the Blending mode"></a>Step 2 - Select the Blending mode</h4><p>On the right side of the screen you’ll be able to see several options such as Transform, Compositing, Border, and Speed, but before you proceed to select the Blending Mode you must first make sure that you’ve selected the video clip you want to enhance.</p><p>In the Compositing menu, you will be able to see the Blending Mode feature. Click on the drop-down menu and select one of the modes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-blending-mode-selection.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Scrn Blending modes"                ></p><p>Changing the Opacity value will enable you to reduce the transparency level of a layer while changing the values in the Transform menu will help you find the perfect position on the background for the overlaying image.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Export-the-video"><a href="#Step-3-Export-the-video" class="headerlink" title="Step 3 - Export the video"></a>Step 3 - Export the video</h4><p>Click on the Export button if you like the results and choose whether you want to save the file on your hard-disc or upload it to YouTube, Facebook or Vimeo directly from Filmora Scrn.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-blending-mode-export.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Scrn Blending modes"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Overlaying two video clips and blending them to each other can be an effective way to make your videos look more creative or more professional by adding logos and all other information you’d like the potential viewers of your videos to see. The blending modes Filmora Scrn offers can help you achieve the visual style you want to get in your videos, but it may take you some time to learn when is the best time to use a certain mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-maximizing-audio-quality-in-lectures-with-macos-for-2024/"><u>[New] Maximizing Audio Quality in Lectures with MacOS for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-firefox-recording-tools-and-extensions-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Firefox Recording Tools & Extensions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-experience-the-ps3-gaming-prowess-on-modern-pcs/"><u>[Updated] Experience the PS3 Gaming Prowess on Modern PCs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-virtual-vice-versa-top-10-alternative-crime-games/"><u>2024 Approved  Virtual Vice Versa  Top 10 Alternative Crime Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastering-mini-gaming-memories-learn-to-record-minecraft-on-apple-devices/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastering Mini-Gaming Memories  Learn to Record Minecraft on Apple Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-navigating-through-vlcs-recording-options/"><u>[New] Navigating Through VLC's Recording Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-selecting-premium-backgrounds-for-zoomgoogle-calls/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Selecting Premium Backgrounds for Zoom/Google Calls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/masterclass-selecting-premium-stream-recorder-apps-for-2024/"><u>Masterclass  Selecting Premium Stream Recorder Apps for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-resource-for-instagram-livestreams-via-obs-software-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Resource for Instagram Livestreams via OBS Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-best-5-camera-apps-to-shoot-and-record-videos-on-iphone-and-andriod/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Best 5 Camera Apps to Shoot and Record Videos on iPhone and Andriod</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-whatsapp-from-apple-iphone-13-pro-max-to-other-iphone-13-pro-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-whatsapp-from-ios-transfer-whatsapp-from-ios/"><u>How To Transfer WhatsApp From Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to other iPhone 13 Pro devices? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-perfect-guide-uploading-subtitles-via-social-networks/"><u>In 2024, Perfect Guide  Uploading Subtitles via Social Networks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-rescue-lost-music-from-moto-g84-5g-by-fonelab-android-recover-music/"><u>How to Rescue Lost Music from Moto G84 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/exploring-imovies-default-crop-settings-for-2024/"><u>Exploring iMovie's Default Crop Settings for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-ultimate-mix-seamless-free-and-paid-blu-ray-playback-windows-macos/"><u>[New] Ultimate Mix  Seamless Free & Paid Blu-Ray Playback (Windows, macOS)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-find-your-favorite-tunes-androids-top-6-music-vids/"><u>[Updated] Find Your Favorite Tunes  Android's Top 6 Music Vids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-creative-setbacks-sudden-content-expulsion/"><u>[Updated] Creative Setbacks  Sudden Content Expulsion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-captivating-videos-start-here-these-7-royalty-free-audios/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Captivating Videos Start Here  These 7 Royalty-Free Audios</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-list-best-video-editing-apps-for-vloggers-ios-and-android/"><u>2024 Approved The Ultimate List Best Video Editing Apps for Vloggers (iOS & Android)</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Understand that Stardew Valley is regarded as a simulation role-playing video game. This video game was developed by no one else but Eric Barone. While it was released in February 2016 for Microsoft Windows, it later made its debut in:</p><ul><li>Xbox one</li><li>PlayStation Vita</li><li>iOS</li><li>Android</li><li>MacOS</li><li>Linux, and even;</li><li>PlayStation 4</li></ul><p>Are you wondering what makes this game interesting? Well, players tend to act as a character who takes complete control over their late grandfather’s already dilapidated farm. And, this farm is located in a place known as Stardew Valley. It must be noted that this game is entirely open-ended as it enables players to take on diverse activities. These activities include:</p><ul><li>Ore mining</li><li>Growing of crops</li><li>Raising some livestock</li><li>Selling of produce, and;</li><li>Crafting of goods</li></ul><p>More so, your character will get to socialize with the people in the town, proceed to marry, and even have kids. Note that roughly three other players can play this game together online. In other news, Stardew Valley has been regarded over time as a masterpiece. It is filled with a relaxing vibe, romance, and, of course, adventure.</p><p>For those interested, the game begins with you, a box of parsnip seeds, and some handy tools. Bear in mind that Stardew Valley has a lot to offer its players. And, the addition of Ginger Island has made the game very popular. Understand that with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, players have begun new farms and are trying to grow tropical produce to make a profit. If you never knew, Stardew Valley Ginger Island is filled with fun activities as well as puzzles.</p><h2 id="Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island"><a href="#Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island" class="headerlink" title="Stardew Valley Ginger Island"></a><strong>Stardew Valley Ginger Island</strong></h2><p>It must be clearly stated that Stardew Valley Ginger Island is where the majority of the new content of Stardew Valley takes place. If you never knew, the 1.5 update of Stardew Valley has a whole lot to offer, ranging from new items, areas, places to build your farm, and even some new characters.</p><p>Above all, Ginger Island is most likely the most significant part of the Stardew Valley 1.5 update. For those who are just starting with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, things may get quite awkward. However, those who already play the Stardew Valley game will be capable of venturing into the quests and solving them. To proceed to Stardew Valley Ginger Island, you will need to restore the community center. Note that this particular task will get players closer to being capable of visiting Ginger Island. However, to restore the community center, you will need to create bundles for no one else but the Junimos. The Junimos are found living inside the community center. By creating all the bundles for the Junimos, they will assist you in restoring the community center. When you are done repairing the community center, you will need to be capable of helping Willy fix his already old boat.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-location.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-location"                ></p><p>Immediately you meet the requirements of restoring the community center and fixing willy’s boat. When you get to the Ginger Island while playing the Stardew Valley Ginger Island game, you will meet Leo. The first thing to know about Leo is that he is a shy person though he is not interested in the player. As a shy person, he befriends both animals and players subtly. When he befriends you, he can begin considering making a move into town. The move to town will make Leo more accessible. In all, Leo is simply a child that will manage to successfully befriend Jas and Vincent whenever he is fully settled in the new home in the Stardew Valley Ginger Island game.</p><h2 id="Features-in-Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island"><a href="#Features-in-Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island" class="headerlink" title="Features in Stardew Valley Ginger Island"></a><strong>Features in Stardew Valley Ginger Island</strong></h2><p>Some of the intriguing addition players will love in Stardew Valley Ginger Island include:</p><h3 id="1-Volcano-dungeon"><a href="#1-Volcano-dungeon" class="headerlink" title="1.Volcano dungeon"></a>1.Volcano dungeon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-volcano-dungeon.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-volcano-dungeon"                ></p><p>This is regarded as an enormous draw for adventurous players. It is lava-filled, and players will encounter nine new enemies, lots of new items, a shop, and a forge. Please do not mistake the Volcano dungeon for the skull cavern as they fi crib differently. If you want to pass through the Volcano dungeon successfully, you will need to solve some puzzles. Also, you will need to make use of the watering can to traverse the lava successfully.</p><h3 id="2-The-Island-trader"><a href="#2-The-Island-trader" class="headerlink" title="2.The Island trader"></a>2.The Island trader</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-the-island-trader.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-the-island-trader"                ></p><p>Among the first things, every farmer will have on their to-do list is to get a hold of some elements on the Island. You can do this easily in the Stardew Valley Ginger Island if you are ready to put in the work to find the golden walnuts. When you restore the Island farmhouse, you can pay ten golden walnuts to build the trader’s hut. From here, you can purchase tropical crop seeds and any other unique items.</p><h3 id="3-Pirates-and-Mermaids"><a href="#3-Pirates-and-Mermaids" class="headerlink" title="3.Pirates and Mermaids"></a>3.Pirates and Mermaids</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-pirates-and-mermaids.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-pirates-and-mermaids"                ></p><p>Does it surprise you that there are mermaids on the Stardew Valley Ginger Island? Well, these mermaids seem to appear on Ginger Island. Aside from the mermaids, you will find a pirate cove filled with pirates. When you converse with the mermaids and pirates, you can unlock some items for your farm.</p><h3 id="4-Fossil-Donations"><a href="#4-Fossil-Donations" class="headerlink" title="4.Fossil Donations"></a>4.Fossil Donations</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-fossil-donations.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-fossil-donations"                ></p><p>Stardew Valley Ginger Island is the home of lots of fossils as players are expected to dig them up. When they are dug, the fossils are carried to Dr. Snail and further donated. When you complete the fossils, you will be given golden walnuts. The golden walnuts take the role of currency of the Stardew Valley Ginger Island game.</p><h3 id="5-Dig-site"><a href="#5-Dig-site" class="headerlink" title="5.Dig site"></a>5.Dig site</h3><p>It is practically a tropical version of the quarry but with some quirks. You will find a mushroom cave positioned near it. And when you are inside, you will find the NPC, Dr. Snail. Bear in mind that this site is capable of spawning mahogany trees and nodes daily. It makes it suitable for farming. When you free Dr. Snail from this vicinity, the Island field office will be unlocked, and the power to donate fossils will be provided.</p><h3 id="6-New-farm"><a href="#6-New-farm" class="headerlink" title="6.New farm"></a>6.New farm</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-new-farm.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-new-farm"                ></p><p>If you love the tropical vibe of Stardew Valley Ginger Island, you can get to settle there. Though it will take some work, the farm can be successfully set up on the Island so that you can live there.</p><h3 id="7-Qi’s-Walnut-Room"><a href="#7-Qi’s-Walnut-Room" class="headerlink" title="7.Qi’s Walnut Room"></a>7.Qi’s Walnut Room</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-walnut-room.png"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-walnut-room"                ></p><p>For those unaware, Qi is the mysterious figure that had the powers to give out huge rewards in this game. Once you collect up to one hundred walnuts, the room will be wide open with plenty of goodies within it. However, the gems of Qi will have to be earned so that you can buy items from the shop.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>On a general note, it is pertinent to note that Stardew Valley Ginger Island has lots of fun to provide to players.

Best Screencastify Alternatives</h2><p>Although the Screencastify extension is a great tool with a dozen of export configurations and editing tools, its usage is limited to the Google Chrome web browser and if you are using any other application for surfing on the internet, then this application is pretty much useless to you.</p><p>However, if you need a screen recorder or a video editing application, then the following are some of the best ones available out there.</p><h3 id="1-Screencast-O-Matic"><a href="#1-Screencast-O-Matic" class="headerlink" title="1. Screencast-O-Matic"></a>1. Screencast-O-Matic</h3><p>The first application that we are discussing is called Screencast-O-Matic and is one of the best alternatives available for Screencastify.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Low-Cost-Hardware-OBS-Optimization-Tips"><a href="#Low-Cost-Hardware-OBS-Optimization-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Low-Cost Hardware: OBS Optimization Tips"></a>Low-Cost Hardware: OBS Optimization Tips</h2><p>In the past two decades, the digital and IT industry is growing at a jet pace. Programmers are inventing more applications to make our life easier. Similarly, the invention of youtube is one of its prevalent examples of all inventions. Billions of people are watching youtube, among them, millions are video streamers. Today Youtubers and other platform streamers are building costly computational machines to stream their videos with high resolutions and frames per second but it’s not the case for everyone like you and I cannot afford to build those high-end PC or Laptops.</p><p>Therefore, after vast research on the internet, our team came up with an optimal solution to show you a way to stream your videos lag-free, jitter-free, and without any blurriness in a costless way possible. We recommend you the best studio software known as OBS for your streaming using the best OBS settings for your low-end PC or a Laptop. These OBS settings will let you record videos for low-end PC or laptops to stream now without any issues. Keeping things in a little hurry let’s straight dive into the real stuff of this article.</p><h2 id="1-Video-Settings"><a href="#1-Video-Settings" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Settings"></a>1. Video Settings</h2><p>Since we are concerned about the streaming of video. It is important to know how to set up your videos settings. To set your video settings you need to follow the steps given below.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Go-to-Settings"><a href="#Step-1-Go-to-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Go to Settings"></a>Step 1: Go to Settings</h3><p>First, you will need to launch your OBS software. On the main menu, you have to go to file-&gt; settings. You will see a new window will pop up for settings as shown in the figure below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-video-settings-go-to-settings.jpg"                      alt="obs video settings go to settings"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Settings-That-You-Should-Keep"><a href="#Step-2-Settings-That-You-Should-Keep" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Settings That You Should Keep"></a>Step 2: Settings That You Should Keep</h3><p>Starting with base resolution, it is the video resolution that we are going to send to the people who are going to watch our stream. So for the best one, click on it and choose <strong>1280*720</strong>.</p><p>Output tab, which is the resolution of the video that the people will watch. For fast and lag-free streaming it’s best to keep both the output and base resolution the same to avoid any conversion between the resolution by CPU. So click on output resolution and choose <strong>1280*720</strong> again. If you noticed your computer is still lagging then it’s best to change to 480p but below this, it’s not recommended.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-settings-that-you-should-keep.jpg"                      alt="obs settings that you should keep"                ></p><p>After that, it comes to the filter option. There are multiple filter options in this tab but for a fast and better result, you have to choose the <strong>“bilinear”</strong> filter as shown in the figure below. Finally, when it comes to frame per second you gotta be careful here. The more the fps the more it will put load on your CPU means it will become laggy but it is best to keep it <strong>30 fps</strong>, not more than this and not less than this if you are using a low-end PC or Laptop.</p><h3 id="Step-3-Output-Settings"><a href="#Step-3-Output-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Output Settings"></a>Step 3: Output Settings</h3><p>Once you are done with the general video settings now it’s time you should come to the output settings. For that, you will need to choose the output from the main vertical tab as shown in the figure below in 1. You will see a new window appears with a variety of settings. Now it’s time to choose the advanced setting as shown in 2 in the figure to see all settings to be edited.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-output-settings-edited.jpg"                      alt="obs output settings edited"                ></p><p>Let’s move towards the detail settings for the output video for your audience it’s best to choose the settings shown in the figure and below for lag-free and jitter-free video.</p><p><strong>Encoder:</strong></p><p>The first setting is the encoder setting for your output video. There are two options for it, if you are not using any NVidia graphics card and relying on CPU then it is best to choose x264, which will utilize your CPU.</p><p><strong>Rescale Output:</strong></p><p>The rescale output settings should be kept the same as 720p of the video you are streaming.</p><p><strong>Rate Control:</strong></p><p>Keep the rate control CBR.</p><p><strong>Bitrate:</strong></p><p>Normally, for low-end PCs, you should keep the bitrate to 3000 kbps. However, if you are finding it struggling with your PC in the form of a lag or jitteriness then it’s recommended to drop it low till you get the better results. For the NVIDIA card keep the bitrate to 3000 as it is perfectly fine for it.</p><p><strong>CPU Usage Preset:</strong></p><p>It comes with a lot of options to keep your CPU usage for the video. It is best recommended to keep the CPU usage very fast for good results. If you are using an NVIDIA graphics card then it is best to change the CPU usage to “performance” to get the best out of your machine.</p><p><strong>Profile:</strong></p><p>By default, the profile option is disabled and you should keep these settings as it is if you are not using the NVIDIA card but if it’s not so then it’s recommended to choose the “main” on the profiling option.</p><p>So that’s it for the video settings. These are all the settings that you need to adjust before streaming. After doing it so you just need to click apply button below and bingo it is done.</p><h2 id="2-Audio-Settings"><a href="#2-Audio-Settings" class="headerlink" title="2. Audio Settings"></a>2. Audio Settings</h2><p>For a clear and better audio performance, it’s also necessary you keep the optimum settings for the audio too. Well, you don’t have to worry now about the audio too. After reading this article you should keep the same audio settings here for your PC or Laptop.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Output-Audio"><a href="#Step-1-Output-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Output Audio"></a>Step 1: Output Audio</h3><p>The audio settings can be adjusted from two places. Let us discuss the first one. For that, you will need to select the output in the vertical tab and go to audio as shown in the figure below. You will see multiple tracks in these windows. It contains the audio settings for multiple sources. However, if you are using a single it’s good to choose 320 in track one. For multiple, there is no need to change the audio track but to keep the same 320. These are the perfect settings for most cases of the audio settings for your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-output-audio-settings-adjust.jpg"                      alt="obs output audio settings adjust"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Audio-Tab-Settings"><a href="#Step-2-Audio-Tab-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Audio Tab Settings"></a>Step 2: Audio Tab Settings</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-audio-tab-settings-steps.jpg"                      alt="obs audio tab settings steps"                ></p><p>The audio consists of many settings,it is divided into categories lets start one by one and explain it.</p><p><strong>Sample Rate and Channels:</strong></p><p>It is the resolution of the audio. The more the sampling rate the more the bits of the audio you sent which means the more the quality of the audio improves. However, there is no need to keep it high but an optimum value works well too. Therefore, keep it <strong>48khz</strong> for the best result as shown. Another thing is a channel, which contains a lot of options but most of you will want the <strong>“stereo”</strong> since it’s the most common choice from the streamers.</p><p><strong>Desktop Audios:</strong></p><p>The desktop audio depends on the device you are using for the audio. It is best to use the default if you don’t know about your device otherwise choose USB if you are audio uses the USB port. For the second audio source, you can choose desktop audio 2 and set it accordingly.</p><p><strong>Auxiliary Audio:</strong></p><p>The streamers usually have one mic source but if you have multiple mic sources then you choose up to 4 auxiliary audio ports and set the device’s settings.</p><p><strong>Meter: Decay Rate &amp; Peak Meter Type:</strong></p><p>The meter is a decibel meter (dB). It is a measurement of volume. The more the decibels, the more it is loud. So use the decay rate to choose between fast, medium, and slow volumes accordingly to your needs. The Peak Meter type is used for your CPU usage. IF you have set higher CPU usage then go for the “true peak” otherwise chose “sample peak”.</p><p>Finally, the rest of the options should be kept as default since being a streamer you won’t need them to change and they are pretty much basic hotkeys to set up if you wish to.</p><h2 id="3-Stream-Settings"><a href="#3-Stream-Settings" class="headerlink" title="3. Stream Settings"></a>3. Stream Settings</h2><p>Here are the streaming settings that you just need to follow for your streaming videos. The streaming tab consists of settings for the platform you are going to stream your video.

After going to the main “stream” tab you will see a bunch of options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-stream-settings-tab-service-1.jpg"                      alt="obs stream settings tab service 1"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Streaming-Settings"><a href="#Step-2-Streaming-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Streaming Settings"></a>Step 2: Streaming Settings</h3><p><strong>Service:</strong></p><p>Here you have to choose the platform on which you are going to stream your videos.

It can be done, we promise! We took a look to try and explain this one a little further after we found out that not everyone knows how it all works.</p><p>WhatsApp is one of our favorite communication apps, especially useful while we are all stuck at home in shelter of the virus. While <a class="link"   href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html" >social distancing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ensues, apps like this one are increasingly important. However, not all of us know how to make WhatsApp calls from a PC – and that’s why we are here!</p><ul><li><a href="#can-you-make-video-call-whatsapp"><strong>Part 1: Can You Make Video Calls on WhatsApp Desktop</strong></a></li><li><a href="#how-to-make-video-call-whatsapp-laptop"><strong>Part 2: How to Make Video Call from WhatsApp Web in Laptop</strong></a></li><li><a href="#WhatsApp-Web-alternative"><strong>Part 3: WhatsApp Web alternative</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Can-You-Make-Video-Calls-on-WhatsApp-Desktop"><a href="#Part-1-Can-You-Make-Video-Calls-on-WhatsApp-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can You Make Video Calls on WhatsApp Desktop"></a>Part 1: Can You Make Video Calls on WhatsApp Desktop</h2><p>Unfortunately, you can’t use WhatsApp on the desktop to make video calls directly.

At first glance, it appears as though the controls are the same, but you are more limited in options because you can’t, seemingly, make video calls.</p><p>What you need is an Emulator. This clever little piece of tech was first invented to do things like playing retro video games through a modern pc. The emulator connects the missing encryptions between the two technologies. In the case of a product called <a class="link"   href="https://www.bluestacks.com/" >Bluestacks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will allow you to run WhatsApp as if it were on your phone, but do it through your computer.</p><p>All you need to do is follow these instructions, and you will be making video calls in WhatsApp web in a laptop in no time!</p><p>In a few easy steps:</p><ol><li>Download an emulator – <a class="link"   href="https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html" >Bluestacks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is considered an industry favorite at the moment.</li><li>Select Save, then run the application.

Skype Online"></a>1. Skype Online</h3><p>Skype is one of the longest-running video calling and web calling apps. It gives you a local international ID to make long-distance calls for free, and much easier. It also has some great functions if you need to work from home or video conference. Skype has excellent customer support and some wonderful add-ons to make the experience more accessible. When it comes to a tailored, professional finish, then Skype has the most experience. You can also <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record Skype video call <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype.JPG"                      alt="Skype"                ></p><h3 id="2-Google-Duo"><a href="#2-Google-Duo" class="headerlink" title="2. Google Duo"></a>2. Google Duo</h3><p>If you can’t figure out how to make video calls on WhatsApp Web on laptops, then Google Duo is a brilliant alternative. It allows HD video and audio chat while working with low bandwidth or bad Wi-Fi. It’s fully compatible with all things made by Google – and it works by signing into your Google account, so your friends don’t need to do very much if you invite them to a call.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-duo-app.JPG"                      alt="Google Duo"                ></p><h3 id="3-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#3-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="3. Facebook Messenger"></a>3. Facebook Messenger</h3><p>If you don’t intend to do much in the way of group chatting, then video calling in Messenger is a reliable way to see friends during the lockdown. Most people have Facebook, it will work with all their products, and it is as easy to join as clicking a link. The downside is that it only works if FB knows who you are. If you closed your account with them, then you will need to start from scratch. That being said, audio and video are both clear, you can add in file sharing, and you have the option to instant message at all times. Plus, it will sync with your contacts in much the same way as Google Duo will.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/messenger-app.JPG"                      alt="Facebook Messenger"                ></p><h2 id="Rounding-Up"><a href="#Rounding-Up" class="headerlink" title="Rounding Up"></a>Rounding Up</h2><p>So if you can’t work out how to make a WhatsApp call from a PC, try one of our other recommendations for keeping in touch. WhatsApp is a wonderfully secure, encrypted messaging service – but it isn’t the only one on the market. It might not even be the right product for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unwind-in-a-world-of-top-stress-busters/"><u>2024 Approved  Unwind in a World of Top Stress Busters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-conquer-windows-10-a-mov-filming-masterclass-for-2024/"><u>[New] Conquer Windows 10  A MOV Filming Masterclass for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-correcting-audio-absence-in-obs-recordings-quickly/"><u>[New] Correcting Audio Absence in OBS Recordings Quickly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/live-stream-enhancements-top-15-non-obs-tools-unveiled/"><u>Live-Stream Enhancements  Top 15 Non-OBS Tools Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-launching-live-recordings-on-hp-computers/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Launching Live Recordings on HP Computers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-acclaimed-editing-software-for-virtual-recordings/"><u>[Updated] Acclaimed Editing Software for Virtual Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/fixing-obss-full-screen-freeze-up-for-2024/"><u>Fixing OBS's Full-Screen Freeze Up for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-how-to-guide-on-bypassing-apple-iphone-12-mini-icloud-activation-lock-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, A How-To Guide on Bypassing Apple iPhone 12 mini iCloud Activation Lock</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-ultimate-tech-gems-best-desktops-revealed/"><u>[Updated] Ultimate Tech Gems - Best Desktops Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-curate-your-learning-best-15-science-yt-experts/"><u>2024 Approved  Curate Your Learning  Best 15 Science YT Experts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/complete-tutorial-to-use-gps-joystick-to-fake-gps-location-on-tecno-pop-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Complete Tutorial to Use GPS Joystick to Fake GPS Location On Tecno Pop 8 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-epic-tiktok-dishes-you-must-try/"><u>[New] Epic TikTok Dishes You Must Try</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-expertise-summary-17-preferred-apps-for-quick-photo-editing/"><u>[New] Expertise Summary  17 Preferred Apps for Quick Photo Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/free-chromebook-screen-recording-tools-ranked/"><u>FREE Chromebook Screen Recording Tools Ranked</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/quick-steps-to-change-weather-location-on-apple-iphone-11-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Quick Steps to Change Weather Location on Apple iPhone 11 | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>
