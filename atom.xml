Users may meet face to face, communicate with associates via in-meeting chatting or conference call, &amp; share their presentations via screen sharing.</p><p>Meetings may be accessed via a PC, Mac, iOS, or Android device. All GoToMeeting sessions (also known as webinars) can be recorded.

How to Record in GoToMeeting with Built-in Recorder</h2><p>Meetings can be recorded using the built-in <strong>gotomeeting recording</strong> option, but there are limits.</p><p>However, recording options must be set up before the commencement of the session. You can only record meetings using GoToMeeting’s meeting recorder if you have a premium account and admin authorization, making it a much less convenient option to record meetings.</p><p>Step 1.

How To Download and Use ShareX?"></a>Part 2. How To Download and Use ShareX?</h2><p>ShareX screen recorder is available for Windows users.

ShareX Alternatives"></a>Part 3. ShareX Alternatives</h2><p>ShareX is not the ideal software to use if your intention is to record your screen. ShareX is the best screenshot capturing tool. Capturing screen video as well as webcam video involves complicated steps. Besides, it lacks necessary customizable settings for recording video as well as there is hardly any editing option for the recorded video.</p><p>Coming to the user interface, it is rather clumsy and not at all intuitive. Besides, ShareX Mac version is not available, and hence, the recorder is only suitable for Windows users. Considering all these drawbacks, it is better to opt for a better alternative.

While many suggest that you need to be a G Suite member to access Google Meet, you do not need to be a member to join a session. All you have to do is make sure you have an active Gmail account and then make your way over to the Google Meet website.</p><p>Once you have opened the website on your laptop or desktop, all you need to do is simply copy the meeting code or link that has been sent to you by the host of the session and paste it into the “Enter a code or link” text box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enter-code-link-to-join-in-google-meet.jpg"                      alt=" enter link to enter google meet"                ></p><p>After doing that, just click the “Join” button and you will be redirected to the joining page of the conference.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/join-google-meet-website.jpg"                      alt="join google meet on website"                ></p><p>From here, click on the “Join” button once again and the participant will join the meeting automatically.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-join-now.jpg"                      alt="google meet join now"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Join-A-Google-Meet-trom-Gmail"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Join-A-Google-Meet-trom-Gmail" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Join A Google Meet trom Gmail?"></a>Part 2: How to Join A Google Meet trom Gmail?</h2><p>Just as a non-G Suite subscriber can <strong>join Google Meet with code</strong> or link through the Meet website. They can also join it through Gmail. Joining a Meet conference through Gmail is exceptionally easy. All you have to do is follow the steps outlined below.</p><p>First, go over to the Gmail website and log in to your Gmail account. Once you have done that, near the bottom left side of your screen you will see two options; “Start a meeting” and “Join a meeting”. To join a meeting through a conference link or code, click “Join a meeting”.</p><p>Upon clicking the “Join a meeting” button, a popup will appear on the screen asking for the meeting code. Here, enter in the meeting code provided to you and click “Join”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/join-google-meet-on-gmail.jpg"                      alt="join in google meet  on Gmail"                ></p><p>The user will be redirected to the main joining screen of Google Meet, where they must click “Join” again to enter the conference.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Join-A-Scheduled-Google-Meet-From-a-Google-Calendar-Event"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Join-A-Scheduled-Google-Meet-From-a-Google-Calendar-Event" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Join A Scheduled Google Meet From a Google Calendar Event?"></a>Part 3: How to Join A Scheduled Google Meet From a Google Calendar Event?</h2><p>Google makes use of very centralized processes, all its applications and functions are integrated. Therefore, you can even join a Google Meet Conference from Google Calendar. However, in this case, an event must be scheduled first by the host, and the participant who is looking to join must be a guest in the event. If you match this criterion then head on over to your Google Calendar to join Google Meet conferences.</p><p>Google Calendar automatically opens to the current day, so all your events from that day are visible on your screen, as shown in the image below.</p><p>From those events, click on the event which you would like to join and a popup will appear on your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/join-google-meet-google-calendar.jpg"                      alt="join in google meet  on calendar"                ></p><p>On the pop-up, users can see a button saying “Join with Google Meet”, click that button and users will automatically be redirected to the main joining page of Google Meet.</p><p>Upon landing on the main joining page, click “Join” and you will become a part of the Meet session you wanted to join.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Join-Google-Meet-Using-Link"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Join-Google-Meet-Using-Link" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Join Google Meet Using Link?"></a>Part 4: How to Join Google Meet Using Link?</h2><p>Did someone invite you to a Google Meet session and send a link instead of the code? Well, you can still join the meeting with a link only as well.

To <strong>make screen recording without watermark</strong> using Filmora, follow the steps below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Open Screen Recorder on Filmora</strong></p><p>Install and launch Wondershare Filmora on your PC. You can select the <strong>“Screen Recorder”</strong> feature from the startup window on Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/game-recording-software-improvement-in-market-11.jpg"                      alt="access screen recorder from homepage"                ></p><p>Alternatively, you can also go to the <strong>“File”</strong> tab and select <strong>“Record Media”</strong> from the dropdown list, then choose to record the webcam, PC screen, or voiceover.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/game-recording-software-improvement-in-market-12.jpg"                      alt="access recording option from interface"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Screen Recording Settings</strong></p><p>Once the Screen Recorder panel opens, you can choose the recording ratio from the menu under the <strong>“Square”</strong> icon. The available options are to record the full screen, a target window, or any custom size. You can then toggle the switches next to the “Microphone,” “System Audio,” and “Camera” options to turn them on or off.

The Editor’s Review"></a>Part 3. The Editor’s Review</h2><p>Now, it is time to give you our final verdict and leave no gap between the lips and the cup.</p><p>Performance: The performance of the application is smooth and flawless. Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording. However, it does take up system resources, and for an old PC, the effect could be significant. But for a modern PC, there is no issue. Therefore, it scores really well as far as performance is concerned.</p><p>Functions: As a standalone screen recorder, the app is perfect from all aspects. Starting from recording full screen and custom screen to recording with and without cursor, all standard features and some advanced features are available. You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.</p><p>Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder. All in all, if you want professional video quality, you have to look for alternatives.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-3"><a href="#Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

This built-in app has provided a great alternative to the traditional methods to record screen videos without the use of third-party apps for iOS users. The built-in screen recorder has made the whole process very easy and simple. Follow the steps mentioned below if you want to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad’s screen.</p><ol><li>If you don’t have a screen recorder toggle on the Control Center, you need to enable the Screen Recording feature in the Settings on your iPhone&#x2F;iPad. First, tap the Settings app, and then tap Control Center &gt; Customize Controls. Find <strong>Screen Recording</strong> then tap the green “+” button beside it to add the Screen Recording feature to Control Center.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/ios11.jpg"                      alt="ios 11"                ></p><ol><li>Open the Control Center by swiping up from the bottom of your iPhone&#x2F;iPad.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ios-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="ios screen recording "                ></p><ol><li>Tap the screen recording icon that looks like a solid circle enclosed in another circle. And you will see the start recording option and a microphone button. If you want to record the microphone audio, then tap it to turn on the microphone.

A notification will also appear on the top indicating recording time.</li><li>After you are done recording, open the control center again and tap on the screen recorder button again.

In the following section, we will show you how to do it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Use-QuickTime-to-Record-Screens-of-iPhone-iPad-Version-Before-iOS-11"><a href="#Part-2-Use-QuickTime-to-Record-Screens-of-iPhone-iPad-Version-Before-iOS-11" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Use QuickTime to Record Screens of iPhone&#x2F;iPad (Version Before iOS 11)"></a>Part 2: Use <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/quicktime" >QuickTime <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to Record Screens of iPhone&#x2F;iPad (Version Before iOS 11)</h2><p>People need to download and install a third-party iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen recorder after jailbreaking the device and going through a complicated installation process. iOS is always risky to jailbreak your device as if you don’t do it carefully your device will get broken. It means your device will stop functioning and you will need to go to Apple care for getting it fixed. Jailbreaking also voids your warranty. So rather than going through these risks, people preferred using QuickTime to record their Phone&#x2F;iPad’s screen.</p><p>With QuickTime media player you could record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad’s Screen. For recording your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen with the help of QuickTime, you would need Mac OS X. Below are the steps to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen on your Mac by using QuickTime.</p><p>1. Connect your iOS device (iPhone&#x2F;iPad&#x2F;iPod touch) to your Mac with a USB cable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/quicktime%20logo.jpg"                      alt="quicktime"                ></p><p>2. Launch QuickTime on your Mac available in the application folder.</p><p>3. Click on the File menu on the QuickTime menu bar and choose New Movie Recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/quicktime%20new%20moive.jpg"                      alt="quicktime"                ></p><p>4. A video recording screen will open. Now slide the cursor over that window to make the record and volume button visible.</p><p>5. Click on the arrow next to the red record button to show the camera and microphone recording options. Choose your device from the list of devices and you will be able to see your device screen in the QuickTime window.</p><p>6. Click on the red record button when you want to start recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/quicktime%20iphone.jpg"                      alt="quicktime screen recorder"                ></p><p>7. To stop the recording of the screen of your iOS device, click on the Stop button at the video recorder window.</p><p>8. If you want to edit the video, you can do it in QuickTime (for basic editing). You can also save the recorded video first and then edit it later. You can directly save it as it is in QuickTime by going to File Menu and clicking on save option.</p><p>The recorded video will be saved in .mov file format which you can later export to view on certain devices. You can edit the video later in QuickTime, Wondershare Filmora, or others and share it online for tutorials or demonstration, and whatever you want to do with it. This method of recording the iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen is useful for devices running the iOS version lower than 11. This is a far safer method to record device screen video than jailbreaking. But with the addition of a mobile screen recorder app in iOS 11 and above, it seems a little bit clumsy by using QuickTime.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen recorder is a very useful tool when you want to record tutorials, demonstrations, or report bugs. The demand for mobile screen recorders is rapidly increasing. Youngsters also love recording funny clips and videos to share the video on social media networks and other platforms. So which method offered above is better, no definite answer. All you need to consider is your own situation.

With the <strong>iPhone&#x2F;iPad built-in screen recorder</strong>, you no longer need to jailbreak your device or install third-party screen recorders.</p><p>So, in this article, we will show you how to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen whether your iOS device is running the latest iOS 11 and later versions or not.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Record Screen with Built-in Screen Recorder in iPhone&#x2F;iPad</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Use QuickTime to record iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Built-in-Screen-Recorder-in-iPhone-iPad-For-iOS-11-and-Later-Versions-3"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Built-in-Screen-Recorder-in-iPhone-iPad-For-iOS-11-and-Later-Versions-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Record Screen with Built-in Screen Recorder in iPhone&#x2F;iPad [For iOS 11 and Later Versions]"></a>Part 1: How to Record Screen with Built-in Screen Recorder in iPhone&#x2F;iPad [For iOS 11 and Later Versions]</h2><p> The iOS 11 has come with a built-in mobile screen recording feature, so if you’re running the iOS 11 and later iOS versions, you can use the free recording tool of iPhone directly. This built-in app has provided a great alternative to the traditional methods to record screen videos without the use of third-party apps for iOS users. The built-in screen recorder has made the whole process very easy and simple. Follow the steps mentioned below if you want to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad’s screen.</p><ol><li>If you don’t have a screen recorder toggle on the Control Center, you need to enable the Screen Recording feature in the Settings on your iPhone&#x2F;iPad. First, tap the Settings app, and then tap Control Center &gt; Customize Controls. Find <strong>Screen Recording</strong> then tap the green “+” button beside it to add the Screen Recording feature to Control Center.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/ios11.jpg"                      alt="ios 11"                ></p><ol><li>Open the Control Center by swiping up from the bottom of your iPhone&#x2F;iPad.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ios-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="ios screen recording "                ></p><ol><li>Tap the screen recording icon that looks like a solid circle enclosed in another circle. And you will see the start recording option and a microphone button. If you want to record the microphone audio, then tap it to turn on the microphone. Then, tap on Start Recording to start.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ios-screen-recording-start.jpg"                      alt=" ios screen recording "                ></p><ol><li>The video recording will start after a 3-second delay and the recording button will turn red. A notification will also appear on the top indicating recording time.</li><li>After you are done recording, open the control center again and tap on the screen recorder button again. Alternatively, you can also tap on the red notification on the top of your screen and tap Stop at the prompt.</li></ol><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/ios%20stop.JPG" alt="iPhone/iPad screen recorder"></p><ol><li>This will stop the screen recording and the recorded video will be saved in the Photos app.</li></ol><p>That’s the steps of how to record your iPhone screen in iOS 11 and later versions. If you want to edit the recorded video with some video editing apps, do not miss <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the top 10 best video editors for iPhone and iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>If your iOS device is running a previous version older than iOS 11, and you do not want to update, then you can record your iPhone screen with some best screen recorders for iOS, or record with QuickTime. In the following section, we will show you how to do it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Use-QuickTime-to-Record-Screens-of-iPhone-iPad-Version-Before-iOS-11-3"><a href="#Part-2-Use-QuickTime-to-Record-Screens-of-iPhone-iPad-Version-Before-iOS-11-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Use QuickTime to Record Screens of iPhone&#x2F;iPad (Version Before iOS 11)"></a>Part 2: Use <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/quicktime" >QuickTime <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to Record Screens of iPhone&#x2F;iPad (Version Before iOS 11)</h2><p>People need to download and install a third-party iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen recorder after jailbreaking the device and going through a complicated installation process. iOS is always risky to jailbreak your device as if you don’t do it carefully your device will get broken. It means your device will stop functioning and you will need to go to Apple care for getting it fixed. Jailbreaking also voids your warranty. So rather than going through these risks, people preferred using QuickTime to record their Phone&#x2F;iPad’s screen.</p><p>With QuickTime media player you could record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad’s Screen. For recording your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen with the help of QuickTime, you would need Mac OS X. Below are the steps to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen on your Mac by using QuickTime.</p><p>1. Connect your iOS device (iPhone&#x2F;iPad&#x2F;iPod touch) to your Mac with a USB cable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/quicktime%20logo.jpg"                      alt="quicktime"                ></p><p>2. Launch QuickTime on your Mac available in the application folder.</p><p>3. Click on the File menu on the QuickTime menu bar and choose New Movie Recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/quicktime%20new%20moive.jpg"                      alt="quicktime"                ></p><p>4. A video recording screen will open. Now slide the cursor over that window to make the record and volume button visible.</p><p>5. Click on the arrow next to the red record button to show the camera and microphone recording options. Choose your device from the list of devices and you will be able to see your device screen in the QuickTime window.</p><p>6. Click on the red record button when you want to start recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/quicktime%20iphone.jpg"                      alt="quicktime screen recorder"                ></p><p>7. To stop the recording of the screen of your iOS device, click on the Stop button at the video recorder window.</p><p>8. If you want to edit the video, you can do it in QuickTime (for basic editing). You can also save the recorded video first and then edit it later. You can directly save it as it is in QuickTime by going to File Menu and clicking on save option.</p><p>The recorded video will be saved in .mov file format which you can later export to view on certain devices. You can edit the video later in QuickTime, Wondershare Filmora, or others and share it online for tutorials or demonstration, and whatever you want to do with it. This method of recording the iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen is useful for devices running the iOS version lower than 11. This is a far safer method to record device screen video than jailbreaking. But with the addition of a mobile screen recorder app in iOS 11 and above, it seems a little bit clumsy by using QuickTime.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen recorder is a very useful tool when you want to record tutorials, demonstrations, or report bugs. The demand for mobile screen recorders is rapidly increasing. Youngsters also love recording funny clips and videos to share the video on social media networks and other platforms. So which method offered above is better, no definite answer. All you need to consider is your own situation.

This is because iOS 11 or later comes with an inbuilt screen recorder option with which you can record YouTube live stream and any video on YouTube. First, you have to enable screen recording feature on your iPhone. Here are the steps you need to follow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="iphone screen recording"                ></p><p>Step 1: Open Settings app and tap on Control Centre.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Customize Controls and from the list, find Screen Recording option and enable it.</p><p>Step 3: Open YouTube app and open the video that you want to record.</p><p>Step 4: Bring up the Control Centre by swiping down or up as per your iPhone model.</p><p>Step 5: Tap on Screen recording icon to start recording. This will start recording and you will see a red bar on the screen. When you are done, you can stop recording from this red bar or blob as you see on your screen.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Record-YouTube-Videos-on-Android"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Record-YouTube-Videos-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How to Record YouTube Videos on Android"></a>Part 4 How to Record YouTube Videos on Android</h2><p>Unlike iPhone, Android does not come with an inbuilt YouTube screen recorder. That is why you will need to install an external screen recording app to capture YouTube videos. We recommend AZ Screen Recorder to capture YouTube videos instantly. Here are all the steps you need to take.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/az-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="az screen recorder"                ></p><p>Step 1: Go to Play Store and install AZ Screen Recorder.</p><p>Step 2: Launch AZ Screen Recorder and you will see an overlay bar on the screen.</p><p>Step 3: Open YouTube app and open the video that you want to record.</p><p>Step 4: On AZ Screen Recorder, tap on Record icon. You will get 3 seconds of buffer time to start playing your YouTube video before recording starts.</p><p>Step 5: When you are done recording, tap on Stop icon on AZ Screen Recorder. The recorded video file will be saved directly on Gallery.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Record-YouTube-Videos-Online"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Record-YouTube-Videos-Online" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 How to Record YouTube Videos Online"></a>Part 5 How to Record YouTube Videos Online</h2><p>If you do not want to install any app on your phone or you do not want to install any software on your computer, you can opt for an online video capturing tool. This is useful for those who are not tech-savvy and want to capture YouTube video on the go. We recommend Screen Capture which is a YouTube recorder and screen capturing online tool.</p><p>Along with video, it can record audio from speakers as well as microphone. The only drawback is that it puts a watermark on the recorded video. To remove the watermark, you have to purchase a premium plan. Here are the simple steps to record any YouTube video with Screen Capture.</p><p>Step 1: Open the web browser on your device.</p><p>Step 2: Visit <a class="link"   href="http://www.screencapture.com/" >www.screencapture.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and turn on Sound option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/screen-capture-recorder-free.jpg"                      alt="screen capture"                ></p><p>Step 3: Open a new tab and open YouTube video that you want to capture.</p><p>Step 4: Come back to Screen Capture and click on Start Recording option.</p><p>Step 5: Select Chrome Tab option and select the tab where you have YouTube video. Click on Share button.</p><p>Step 6: When you are done recording, click on Stop Recording. Review the recorded video and click on Download button to save the video on your hard drive.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Depending on the device you are using, you have to follow the specific method on how to record YouTube videos. For iPhone users, screen recording feature comes inbuilt, and you just need to activate it to capture YouTube video.

This is because iOS 11 or later comes with an inbuilt screen recorder option with which you can record YouTube live stream and any video on YouTube. First, you have to enable screen recording feature on your iPhone. Here are the steps you need to follow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="iphone screen recording"                ></p><p>Step 1: Open Settings app and tap on Control Centre.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Customize Controls and from the list, find Screen Recording option and enable it.</p><p>Step 3: Open YouTube app and open the video that you want to record.</p><p>Step 4: Bring up the Control Centre by swiping down or up as per your iPhone model.</p><p>Step 5: Tap on Screen recording icon to start recording. This will start recording and you will see a red bar on the screen. When you are done, you can stop recording from this red bar or blob as you see on your screen.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Record-YouTube-Videos-on-Android-1"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Record-YouTube-Videos-on-Android-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How to Record YouTube Videos on Android"></a>Part 4 How to Record YouTube Videos on Android</h2><p>Unlike iPhone, Android does not come with an inbuilt YouTube screen recorder. That is why you will need to install an external screen recording app to capture YouTube videos. We recommend AZ Screen Recorder to capture YouTube videos instantly. Here are all the steps you need to take.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/az-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="az screen recorder"                ></p><p>Step 1: Go to Play Store and install AZ Screen Recorder.</p><p>Step 2: Launch AZ Screen Recorder and you will see an overlay bar on the screen.</p><p>Step 3: Open YouTube app and open the video that you want to record.</p><p>Step 4: On AZ Screen Recorder, tap on Record icon. You will get 3 seconds of buffer time to start playing your YouTube video before recording starts.</p><p>Step 5: When you are done recording, tap on Stop icon on AZ Screen Recorder. The recorded video file will be saved directly on Gallery.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Record-YouTube-Videos-Online-1"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Record-YouTube-Videos-Online-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 How to Record YouTube Videos Online"></a>Part 5 How to Record YouTube Videos Online</h2><p>If you do not want to install any app on your phone or you do not want to install any software on your computer, you can opt for an online video capturing tool. This is useful for those who are not tech-savvy and want to capture YouTube video on the go. We recommend Screen Capture which is a YouTube recorder and screen capturing online tool.</p><p>Along with video, it can record audio from speakers as well as microphone. The only drawback is that it puts a watermark on the recorded video. To remove the watermark, you have to purchase a premium plan. Here are the simple steps to record any YouTube video with Screen Capture.</p><p>Step 1: Open the web browser on your device.</p><p>Step 2: Visit <a class="link"   href="http://www.screencapture.com/" >www.screencapture.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and turn on Sound option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/screen-capture-recorder-free.jpg"                      alt="screen capture"                ></p><p>Step 3: Open a new tab and open YouTube video that you want to capture.</p><p>Step 4: Come back to Screen Capture and click on Start Recording option.</p><p>Step 5: Select Chrome Tab option and select the tab where you have YouTube video. Click on Share button.</p><p>Step 6: When you are done recording, click on Stop Recording. Review the recorded video and click on Download button to save the video on your hard drive.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Depending on the device you are using, you have to follow the specific method on how to record YouTube videos. For iPhone users, screen recording feature comes inbuilt, and you just need to activate it to capture YouTube video. Android users can use AZ Screen Recorder app. If you are looking for an online tool, Screen Capture is great provided you opt for its premium plan to remove watermark.

This is because iOS 11 or later comes with an inbuilt screen recorder option with which you can record YouTube live stream and any video on YouTube. First, you have to enable screen recording feature on your iPhone. Here are the steps you need to follow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="iphone screen recording"                ></p><p>Step 1: Open Settings app and tap on Control Centre.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Customize Controls and from the list, find Screen Recording option and enable it.</p><p>Step 3: Open YouTube app and open the video that you want to record.</p><p>Step 4: Bring up the Control Centre by swiping down or up as per your iPhone model.</p><p>Step 5: Tap on Screen recording icon to start recording. This will start recording and you will see a red bar on the screen. When you are done, you can stop recording from this red bar or blob as you see on your screen.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Record-YouTube-Videos-on-Android-2"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Record-YouTube-Videos-on-Android-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How to Record YouTube Videos on Android"></a>Part 4 How to Record YouTube Videos on Android</h2><p>Unlike iPhone, Android does not come with an inbuilt YouTube screen recorder. That is why you will need to install an external screen recording app to capture YouTube videos. We recommend AZ Screen Recorder to capture YouTube videos instantly. Here are all the steps you need to take.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/az-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="az screen recorder"                ></p><p>Step 1: Go to Play Store and install AZ Screen Recorder.</p><p>Step 2: Launch AZ Screen Recorder and you will see an overlay bar on the screen.</p><p>Step 3: Open YouTube app and open the video that you want to record.</p><p>Step 4: On AZ Screen Recorder, tap on Record icon. You will get 3 seconds of buffer time to start playing your YouTube video before recording starts.</p><p>Step 5: When you are done recording, tap on Stop icon on AZ Screen Recorder. The recorded video file will be saved directly on Gallery.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Record-YouTube-Videos-Online-2"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Record-YouTube-Videos-Online-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 How to Record YouTube Videos Online"></a>Part 5 How to Record YouTube Videos Online</h2><p>If you do not want to install any app on your phone or you do not want to install any software on your computer, you can opt for an online video capturing tool. This is useful for those who are not tech-savvy and want to capture YouTube video on the go. We recommend Screen Capture which is a YouTube recorder and screen capturing online tool.</p><p>Along with video, it can record audio from speakers as well as microphone. The only drawback is that it puts a watermark on the recorded video. To remove the watermark, you have to purchase a premium plan. Here are the simple steps to record any YouTube video with Screen Capture.</p><p>Step 1: Open the web browser on your device.</p><p>Step 2: Visit <a class="link"   href="http://www.screencapture.com/" >www.screencapture.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and turn on Sound option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/screen-capture-recorder-free.jpg"                      alt="screen capture"                ></p><p>Step 3: Open a new tab and open YouTube video that you want to capture.</p><p>Step 4: Come back to Screen Capture and click on Start Recording option.</p><p>Step 5: Select Chrome Tab option and select the tab where you have YouTube video. Click on Share button.</p><p>Step 6: When you are done recording, click on Stop Recording. Review the recorded video and click on Download button to save the video on your hard drive.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Depending on the device you are using, you have to follow the specific method on how to record YouTube videos. For iPhone users, screen recording feature comes inbuilt, and you just need to activate it to capture YouTube video. Android users can use AZ Screen Recorder app. If you are looking for an online tool, Screen Capture is great provided you opt for its premium plan to remove watermark.

This is because iOS 11 or later comes with an inbuilt screen recorder option with which you can record YouTube live stream and any video on YouTube. First, you have to enable screen recording feature on your iPhone. Here are the steps you need to follow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="iphone screen recording"                ></p><p>Step 1: Open Settings app and tap on Control Centre.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Customize Controls and from the list, find Screen Recording option and enable it.</p><p>Step 3: Open YouTube app and open the video that you want to record.</p><p>Step 4: Bring up the Control Centre by swiping down or up as per your iPhone model.</p><p>Step 5: Tap on Screen recording icon to start recording. This will start recording and you will see a red bar on the screen. When you are done, you can stop recording from this red bar or blob as you see on your screen.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Record-YouTube-Videos-on-Android-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Record-YouTube-Videos-on-Android-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How to Record YouTube Videos on Android"></a>Part 4 How to Record YouTube Videos on Android</h2><p>Unlike iPhone, Android does not come with an inbuilt YouTube screen recorder. That is why you will need to install an external screen recording app to capture YouTube videos. We recommend AZ Screen Recorder to capture YouTube videos instantly. Here are all the steps you need to take.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/az-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="az screen recorder"                ></p><p>Step 1: Go to Play Store and install AZ Screen Recorder.</p><p>Step 2: Launch AZ Screen Recorder and you will see an overlay bar on the screen.</p><p>Step 3: Open YouTube app and open the video that you want to record.</p><p>Step 4: On AZ Screen Recorder, tap on Record icon. You will get 3 seconds of buffer time to start playing your YouTube video before recording starts.</p><p>Step 5: When you are done recording, tap on Stop icon on AZ Screen Recorder. The recorded video file will be saved directly on Gallery.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Record-YouTube-Videos-Online-3"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Record-YouTube-Videos-Online-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 How to Record YouTube Videos Online"></a>Part 5 How to Record YouTube Videos Online</h2><p>If you do not want to install any app on your phone or you do not want to install any software on your computer, you can opt for an online video capturing tool. This is useful for those who are not tech-savvy and want to capture YouTube video on the go. We recommend Screen Capture which is a YouTube recorder and screen capturing online tool.</p><p>Along with video, it can record audio from speakers as well as microphone. The only drawback is that it puts a watermark on the recorded video. To remove the watermark, you have to purchase a premium plan. Here are the simple steps to record any YouTube video with Screen Capture.</p><p>Step 1: Open the web browser on your device.</p><p>Step 2: Visit <a class="link"   href="http://www.screencapture.com/" >www.screencapture.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and turn on Sound option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/screen-capture-recorder-free.jpg"                      alt="screen capture"                ></p><p>Step 3: Open a new tab and open YouTube video that you want to capture.</p><p>Step 4: Come back to Screen Capture and click on Start Recording option.</p><p>Step 5: Select Chrome Tab option and select the tab where you have YouTube video. Click on Share button.</p><p>Step 6: When you are done recording, click on Stop Recording. Review the recorded video and click on Download button to save the video on your hard drive.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Depending on the device you are using, you have to follow the specific method on how to record YouTube videos. For iPhone users, screen recording feature comes inbuilt, and you just need to activate it to capture YouTube video. Android users can use AZ Screen Recorder app. If you are looking for an online tool, Screen Capture is great provided you opt for its premium plan to remove watermark. For Windows PC and Mac, you can use Wondershare Filmora to capture YouTube video and edit it out as required.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"

You’ve probably heard these terms used to describe recent hit games such as <em>Hades</em>, <em>Dead Cells,</em> and <em>Binding of Isaac</em> and have wondered if there’s a difference. While both of these game types share a lot of common elements and the lines between them are seemingly blurred, there is a clear distinction between roguelikes and roguelites.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/isaac-poster.jpg"                      alt="isaac-poster"                ></p><hr><p><strong>This article contains:</strong></p><hr><p>Part 1: What’s the Difference Between Roguelikes and Roguelites?</p><hr><h3 id="Rogue-Where-it-all-started"><a href="#Rogue-Where-it-all-started" class="headerlink" title="Rogue: Where it all started"></a>Rogue: Where it all started</h3><p>In order to best understand these two game genres, we must first analyze the origin of their namesakes. Way back in 1980, game designers Michael Toy and Glenn Wichman released an ASCII art dungeon crawler called <em>Rogue</em>. Inspired by the pen-and-paper RPG <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, this turn-based adventure game had players explore dungeons in which they fought monsters and gathered items to help them power up their characters. The game’s defining mechanic was <strong>permadeath</strong>. This meant that once your character died, it was literally the end. You couldn’t create a save nor revive your fallen hero in any way. Starting over meant a completely fresh game with a brand new character. What’s more is that starting a new game meant the dungeons were completely different, including enemy placement, room location, and item distribution. Every decision could mean either living and carrying on or dying and starting over, making the choices players made meaningful.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/michael-toy-glenn-wichman.jpg"                      alt="michael-toy-glenn-wichman"                ></p><h2 id="What-is-a-Roguelike-Game"><a href="#What-is-a-Roguelike-Game" class="headerlink" title="What is a Roguelike Game?"></a>What is a Roguelike Game?</h2><p>As the name implies, a roguelike - or roguelike - is a game that shares the same mechanics that defined <em>Rogue</em>. They have procedurally generated environments, making every playthrough feel completely fresh and different. Dying in a roguelike means all progress is lost, and you need to start over, no saves, no lives, no ifs nor buts. It’s at this juncture where some debate exists as to what truly defines a roguelike. There are fans out there who’ll tell you that a roguelike must not only share the mechanics but also the game’s layout and combat system. According to them, since <em>Rogue</em> was a top-down third-person turn-based RPG that played on a grid, all true roguelikes should then play and look the same. The other camp sees roguelikes as purely defined by true permadeath with some leniency afforded with regards to less important elements such as player perspective, combat systems, and screen orientation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rogue-poster.jpg"                      alt="rogue-poster"                ></p><h2 id="What-is-a-Roguelite-Game"><a href="#What-is-a-Roguelite-Game" class="headerlink" title="What is a Roguelite Game?"></a>What is a Roguelite Game?</h2><p>Roguelites - or rogue-lites - in essence, employ a lighter approach to implementing <em>Rogue</em>‘s key characteristics. For the most part, roguelites still have permadeath. If you die, then you have to start over. However, the <strong>key difference</strong> is that roguelites allow you to carry over some form of progress from one playthrough to the next. Depending on the game, the way progress is carried over varies. Some games allow you to unlock additional items that can drop in a given run. Others open up access to new areas or provide you with abilities that enable you to traverse towards new locations and expand your area of exploration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unlock-hades.jpg"                      alt="unlock-hades"                ></p><p>Roguelites also have procedurally generated environments in a lot of cases. There are titles that have completely random level layouts and enemy placements. Others draw from a pre-defined set of layouts that are mixed and matched. Some titles may simply randomize more minute elements such as item placement and the locations of points of interest. Another way roguelites differ in the way they handle procedural generation is through seeded runs. A seed is essentially a run with pre-determined parameters, including enemy types and placements, level layout, and item availability. Seeding is also used to generate special challenge runs as well as enable custom modes. Whatever the case, roguelites have a tendency to reign in the chaos of fully procedurally generated game content.</p><p>It’s roguelites that are also usually a mix of different genres with <em>Rogue</em> style mechanics. From action RPGs to card games, the roguelite genre’s offerings are quite expansive. The leniency they give when it comes to permadeath and randomness affords developers more design space in which they can craft unique experiences.</p><hr><h2 id="A-Clear-Distinction"><a href="#A-Clear-Distinction" class="headerlink" title="A Clear Distinction"></a>A Clear Distinction</h2><p>Regardless of where you stand on what defines a faithful roguelike, the distinction between it and roguelites is quite straightforward. You know you are playing a roguelike when dying means you <strong>lose it all</strong>. No matter how far into the game you’ve progressed, one misstep means all of the time and work you put into your progress has come to an end. Roguelites, on the other hand, prefer to give you <strong>some sense of progression</strong>, making them <strong>friendlier</strong> for players who don’t want to play with the stress of potentially losing everything.</p><p>There’s an argument to be made that roguelikes give you a truly unique experience each time while roguelites end up becoming grindy and repetitive. When every little decision you make can lead you to lose your character and progress, you become more focused on your run, rather than the game as a whole. You’re forced to play your best, scrutinize every possible choice, and make meaningful comparisons between items and gear you come across. The risk is higher when playing roguelikes, but the reward and payoff of making it far in a run are quite big.</p><p>If you were to conclude that roguelikes are for the <strong>hardest of core gamers</strong> and roguelites are more <strong>casual</strong> in nature, you would be quite close to the mark. A lot of roguelite titles, however, have difficulty settings that can turn them into absolutely brutal experiences, rendering progress and unlocks less important than the player’s overall skill.</p><hr><p>Part 2: Examples of Roguelike and Roguelite Titles</p><p>If you’ve been meaning to dive into either or both of these genres, we’ve got a few titles for you to check out.</p><p><strong>You might also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Roguelike or Roguelite Games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><hr><h3 id="Roguelike-Games"><a href="#Roguelike-Games" class="headerlink" title="Roguelike Games"></a>Roguelike Games</h3><p>For this list, we’re using the “true” definition of roguelike, meaning games that are almost exactly like <em>Rogue</em>.</p><h4 id="Nethack"><a href="#Nethack" class="headerlink" title="Nethack"></a>Nethack</h4><p><em>Nethack</em> is considered one of the most important roguelikes as it is as close to <em>Rogue</em> as a game can get. Apart from permadeath and procedurally generated environments, it shares a lot of <em>Rogue’s</em> core attributes, including the ASCII art style and screen layout. Compared to <em>Rogue</em>, <em>Nethack</em> has a much larger collection of enemies and items, making exploring its world more rewarding. <em>Nethack</em> also includes “conducts” which are special limitations players can choose to impose upon themselves in order to make the game even more challenging.</p><h4 id="Caves-of-Qud"><a href="#Caves-of-Qud" class="headerlink" title="Caves of Qud"></a>Caves of Qud</h4><p>Straying a bit from <em>Rogue’s</em> high fantasy setting, <em>Caves of Qud</em> mixes some science fiction into its world. Just like <em>Rogue</em>, dying means your progress goes caput. Environments, however, are only partially generated randomly, with some elements being pre-defined. The game also includes a robust mutation system to power up your character as well as quests and side-quests which you can choose to follow or ignore. On top of all this, <em>Caves of Qud</em> adds another layer of randomness through its procedurally generated political systems.</p><h4 id="Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup"><a href="#Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup" class="headerlink" title="Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup"></a>Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup</h4><p>Recognized as one of the best roguelikes of all time, <em>Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup</em> is one of the true innovators of its space. Taking all of the core defining elements of <em>Rogue</em>, including its hyper retro art style, <em>DCSS</em> makes a concerted effort towards being more accessible. For starters, it offers a more user-friendly interface that brings all important information to the forefront. The developers also wanted to make its gameplay far easier to understand so that any person can pick it up and play without needing any convoluted prior knowledge of how the game works.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dungeon-crawl-stone-soup.png"                      alt="dungeon-crawl-stone-soup"                ></p><hr><h3 id="Roguelite-Games"><a href="#Roguelite-Games" class="headerlink" title="Roguelite Games"></a>Roguelite Games</h3><p>For this genre, we’ve chosen three games that are completely different to illustrate the wider variety of titles that exists within the roguelite space.</p><h4 id="Dead-Cells"><a href="#Dead-Cells" class="headerlink" title="Dead Cells"></a>Dead Cells</h4><p><em>Dead Cells</em> is an exploration-based action platformer (a.k.a. a metroidvania) with roguelite elements. Just like all _Rogue_-based games, dying in <em>Dead Cells</em> means you start over from the beginning. However, not <strong>all progress</strong> is lost. As you progress through various biomes of the game, you’ll unlock new traversal abilities that allow you to access new biomes and pathways. While some randomness exists in each biome, it feels less like levels are procedurally generated and more like a mixing of pre-determined layout components. You’ll also stumble upon blueprints for items which you can then spend Cells you gather to make the items available to drop in future runs. By beating the game’s final boss you can unlock progressively harder difficulties, making the game increasingly more brutal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deadcells-poster.png"                      alt="deadcells-poster"                ></p><h4 id="Slay-the-Spire"><a href="#Slay-the-Spire" class="headerlink" title="Slay the Spire"></a>Slay the Spire</h4><p>One of the most highly praised indie games, MegaCrit’s <em>Slay the Spire</em> is a shining example of a perfect blend of genres. It’s a deckbuilding card game where you must climb the titular Spire while defeating enemies and bosses in turn-based card battles, so you can ultimately slay its heart. Each run consists of 3 Acts, each of which gives you choices of pathways that are procedurally generated. While enemy placement is somewhat controlled at first, it becomes more truly random the higher you climb. What makes StS particularly challenging is that it affords very few options to restore health so guarding your HP is vital. While death does mean you’ll have to start all the way from the bottom, you can unlock new cards for each of the game’s 4 classes as you level them up. The game also offers a wide variety of options for challenges and seeded custom runs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slay-the-spire.png"                      alt="slay-the-spire"                ></p><h4 id="Hades"><a href="#Hades" class="headerlink" title="Hades"></a>Hades</h4><p>Nominated for a Game of the Year award, <em>Hades</em> is a beloved title that has converted many gamers to the roguelite genre. Your aim in the game, as the son of Hades, is to escape the Ancient Greek hell and ascend to the top of Olympus with the rest of the pantheon. The gameplay is fast-paced action hack-and-slash but it’s in a top-down perspective which makes it feel a lot closer to <em>Rogue</em> than other games in the genre. It also has a lot of elements that are randomized, including the location of helpful shops. Your build will also feel wildly different between runs as even the Gods that appear to power you up are random as well as the abilities they offer you to choose from.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirror-hades.png"                      alt="deadcells-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Bonus:</strong> With thousand of effects, Filmora X help you record your gameplay and edit it into nice montage.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><h5 id="Ollie-Mattison-1"><a href="#Ollie-Mattison-1" class="headerlink" title="Ollie Mattison"></a>Ollie Mattison</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>Game developers and designers have experimented with a variety of video game genres across the years.

By beating the game’s final boss you can unlock progressively harder difficulties, making the game increasingly more brutal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deadcells-poster.png"                      alt="deadcells-poster"                ></p><h4 id="Slay-the-Spire-1"><a href="#Slay-the-Spire-1" class="headerlink" title="Slay the Spire"></a>Slay the Spire</h4><p>One of the most highly praised indie games, MegaCrit’s <em>Slay the Spire</em> is a shining example of a perfect blend of genres. It’s a deckbuilding card game where you must climb the titular Spire while defeating enemies and bosses in turn-based card battles, so you can ultimately slay its heart. Each run consists of 3 Acts, each of which gives you choices of pathways that are procedurally generated. While enemy placement is somewhat controlled at first, it becomes more truly random the higher you climb. What makes StS particularly challenging is that it affords very few options to restore health so guarding your HP is vital. While death does mean you’ll have to start all the way from the bottom, you can unlock new cards for each of the game’s 4 classes as you level them up. The game also offers a wide variety of options for challenges and seeded custom runs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slay-the-spire.png"                      alt="slay-the-spire"                ></p><h4 id="Hades-1"><a href="#Hades-1" class="headerlink" title="Hades"></a>Hades</h4><p>Nominated for a Game of the Year award, <em>Hades</em> is a beloved title that has converted many gamers to the roguelite genre. Your aim in the game, as the son of Hades, is to escape the Ancient Greek hell and ascend to the top of Olympus with the rest of the pantheon. The gameplay is fast-paced action hack-and-slash but it’s in a top-down perspective which makes it feel a lot closer to <em>Rogue</em> than other games in the genre. It also has a lot of elements that are randomized, including the location of helpful shops. Your build will also feel wildly different between runs as even the Gods that appear to power you up are random as well as the abilities they offer you to choose from.</p><p><img
