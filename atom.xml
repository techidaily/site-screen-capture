Comparison ShadowPlay vs OBS"></a>Part 2. Comparison ShadowPlay vs OBS</h2><p>Here are the key points of differences between OBS and ShadowPlay that will help you decide between OBS or ShadowPlay.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS</strong> <strong>Recording:</strong></p><p>While recording, OBS allows faster processing of the recorded video files. Besides, it can compress the file size during the encoding process so that the recorded video files take relatively less space. This makes it ideal for longer sessions of gameplay recording. However, in the process, OBS can reduce the frame rate significantly, and hence, the video may not be as smooth as you expect it to be. Therefore, OBS is suitable for regular game recording where not much compression is required.</p><p>On the contrary, ShadowPlay does not reduce the file size or frame rate, and hence, it is a great choice for high-end games where you need the recorded to be as smooth as possible. However, ShadowPlay requires more space on the hard drive. When you upload on video streaming platforms, there will be some automatic compression. Therefore, the less compression you do during your encoding phase, the better will be the output.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Performance:</strong></p><p>OBS uses significant CPU power and resources. This is one of the reasons why it reduces the frame rate while recording to use less CPU resources. In fact, it can affect the game performance if you are playing and recording a high-end game. However, you can customize various configuration parameters to reduce its burden on CPU performance.</p><p>ShadowPlay does not affect the CPU performance as it comes with hardware acceleration. It supports higher frame rates for high-end games as well. If at all, it can bring about 5%-10% effect on CPU performance which is almost ignorable in comparison to OBS.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS File Format</strong>:</p><p>OBS consumes less space for recorded videos. It compresses the format which can drastically reduce the output file size. The best thing about OBS is that it comes with the NVENC hardware encoded chip that allows choosing from different supported file formats.</p><p>On the contrary, ShadowPlay supports MP4 formats by default which makes it require more space. It uses  codec. MP4 file format is the most popular video file format that you can play across all media players and upload on online platforms.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Live Streaming</strong>:</p><p>You cannot live stream as well as record on ShadowPlay. This is a major drawback that OBS has overcome. That is why most gamers prefer OBS Studio for live streaming as they can record the gaming session for future reference. If you want to just broadcast your gameplay, ShadowPlay is good enough. But if you want to have multiple scenes and overlay adjustments in live streaming, OBS is the best choice.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Editing:</strong></p><p>OBS offers better editing options thanks to its built-in editor. Starting customizable transitions to real-time editing before broadcasting, OBS has different editing scopes tailor-made for gamers. On the contrary, ShadowPlay has very limited editing options as the main focus is on recording only. But if we talk about true video editing, both applications are still underdeveloped on this front.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Alternative-Way-To-Record-Games"><a href="#Part-3-Alternative-Way-To-Record-Games" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

The 4K Pro is the first mass-market 4K webcam in the world. It is also loaded with extra features to produce beautiful videos, far surpassing the needs of most users. Although Skype and Messenger users might not find the 4K Pro cost-effective ($199!) tech enthusiasts and pro-streamers will. Because what the 4K Pro offers is a glimpse into the 4K future!</p><p>In this article we will provide a comprehensive review of this Logitech 4K webcam, breaking it down to the essentials, so you can decide if this is the gadget for your YouTube streaming or video recordings.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Hardware Specification Glimpse</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Logitech 4K Webcam Design Review</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Picture and Sound Quality Test</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Logitech 4K Webcam main features</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Logitech 4K Webcam Recording Capabilities Test</a></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logitech-4k-pro-webcam.jpg"                      alt=" Logitech 4K Webcam "                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Logitech’s-4K-Pro-camera-Hardware-Specification"><a href="#Part-1-Logitech’s-4K-Pro-camera-Hardware-Specification" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Logitech’s 4K Pro camera Hardware Specification"></a>Part 1: Logitech’s 4K Pro camera Hardware Specification</h2><p>The Logitech 4K Pro features <strong>4K Ultra HD streaming up to 4096 x 2160 pixels at 30 FPS</strong>. It also streams 1080p Full HD at either 30 FPS or 60 FPs and 720p HD at 30, 60 and 90 FPS. This range of options is essential because, without a monitor that supports 4K Ultra HD, you won’t be able to use the 4K Pro’s 4K capabilities. <strong>Logitech’s RightLight 3 with HDR</strong> further enhances the video, allowing for streaming in various lighting environments ranging from direct sunlight to low-light.</p><p>It also has <strong>plug-and-play capabilities</strong>, with USB 2.0 Type A and USB 3.0 Type A and C connectivity. It has the best out-of-the-box settings we’ve seen in a webcam. However, to get the most out the 4K Pro you need to <strong>download the Logitech Camera Settings app from Logitech’s website</strong>. The app makes available all the 4K Pro’s camera controls such as pan and 5x digital zoom in Full HD as well as the ability to calibrate brightness, contrast and white balance. It also lets you choose between standard and widescreen displays or change the field of view (FOV) from 90 degrees to 78 or 65 degrees.</p><p>The Logitech also has a <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Background Replacement Feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, enabled through a separate download, and <strong>built-in dual omnidirectional mics with automatic background noise cancellation</strong>.</p><p>The camera’s system requirements are Windows 7 (1080p only), Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and masOS 10.10 or higher. For Chromebooks, it requires Version 29.0.1547.70, Platform 4319.79.0 with a 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Dual Processor and 2 GB of RAM.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Compact-Design"><a href="#Part-2-Compact-Design" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Compact Design"></a>Part 2: Compact Design</h2><p>The 4K Pro manages to fit all those features into a slim design. <strong>It’s just</strong> <strong>4 x 1.1 x 1.1-inches</strong>. Because of its aluminium casing, it is also light, weighing just two ounces. The 4K Pro’s layout is simple, with the 4K lens in the centre between the two omnidirectional, noise-cancelling microphones.</p><p>The unit is mounted to a rubber-coated flexible arm that can clip onto the top of a laptop or flat-screen monitor. The rubber arm allows the camera to be tilted and contorted for greater customisation. <strong>Unfortunately, the 4K Pro’s mount is a step-down in build quality from the C920 and C922</strong>. Logitech’s webcams usually have some of the best clips in the business, because they are made of hard plastic that locks them tight against your screen. The 4K Pro’s arm takes a little getting used to and it can wobble and even fall off if you’re not careful. However, I can understand why Logitech made the change. The 4K Pro’s arm is detachable and reveals a square plastic piece on the bottom of the stand which folds out, allowing the camera to stand freely on any flat surface. Alternatively, the stand can be removed to place the camera on a tripod mount.</p><p><strong>The 4K Pros 4.9-feet cable is also detachable</strong>, so you can replace it with a more compatible connector of your choosing. There are two accessories included with the 4K Pro. A plastic privacy shutter that clips over the camera unit with a small-hinged flap that can be lowered over the lens when you’re not using it. As well as a microfiber drawstring bag to transport the 4K Pro in.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.zonealarm.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38658749&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sc1.checkpoint.com/sc1/za/images/boxes/pa_500.png"                      border="0"                >ZoneAlarm Pro Antivirus + Firewall NextGen</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-is-the-Picture-and-Sound-Quality-recorded-by-Logitech-4K-Webcam"><a href="#Part-3-How-is-the-Picture-and-Sound-Quality-recorded-by-Logitech-4K-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How is the Picture and Sound Quality recorded by Logitech 4K Webcam?"></a>Part 3: How is the Picture and Sound Quality recorded by Logitech 4K Webcam?</h2><p><strong>There’s no question Logitech’s 4K Pro takes the best-looking pictures out of all the external webcams on the market</strong>. Its unparalleled quality is enhanced by Logitech’s RightLight 3 with HDR technology, allowing it to adjust to all lighting environments; whether it be under fluorescent lighting or natural light. Recordings are wide-screen, with real-to-life colours and sharp details. <strong>Thanks to the wide 90-degree lens, it also captures more of the background then its competitors</strong>. However, as mentioned in the specifications section, you have to download the Logitech Camera Settings App to unlock all the 4K Pro’s features.</p><p><strong>The dual omnidirectional microphones produce crystal clear sound</strong>. The automatic background noise-cancellation worked well in all environments and the recorded audio was nice and loud.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075482/7443" target="_top" id="2075482"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075482"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075482/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-How-effective-are-the-main-features-of-the-4K-Webcam"><a href="#Part-4-How-effective-are-the-main-features-of-the-4K-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How effective are the main features of the 4K Webcam?"></a>Part 4: How effective are the main features of the 4K Webcam?</h2><p>As mentioned in the specifications section, there’s an optional Background Replacement Feature, which is powered by Personify. The feature is in its beta stage, which is why it’s not built into the app. Instead, you need to download an extra driver to get it to work. <strong>But despite being in beta, the Background Replacement Feature works really, really well</strong>.</p><p>There’s a cool new feature, which I have not seen on other webcams, that blurs the background to keep out the details you might want to keep hidden! The Chromakey pre-set green-screen background is <strong>great for game streaming on Twitch or YouTube</strong>.</p><p><strong>The 4K Pro also uses an infrared camera to support facial recognition to log in via Windows Hello</strong>. This is such a cutting-edge and exciting feature and it worked well regardless of the lighting environment.</p><p>Also, once you have downloaded the Logitech Camera Settings App it is very easy to customise your videos. The multiple field-of-vision options and 5x digital zoom allow you to take control of the shot and are fantastic integrations for video-conferencing.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-About-the-4K-Webcam-Recording-Capabilities"><a href="#Part-5-How-About-the-4K-Webcam-Recording-Capabilities" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How About the 4K Webcam Recording Capabilities?"></a>Part 5: How About the 4K Webcam Recording Capabilities?</h2><p><strong>Right now, there aren’t many ways you can use the Logitech 4K Pro at its full 4K resolution.</strong> The issue is that 4K Ultra HD has yet to make the kind of impact in the online market that it has in home entertainment. The most popular video-chatting apps, including Google Hangouts and Skype for Business, don’t support 4K. <strong>You’ll also need a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4k Monitor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to truly appreciate the picture</strong> and if who you’re chatting to online doesn’t have one, then they’ll only see you in 1080p. You can stream 4K videos to YouTube if you have enough bandwidth. Besides the 4K monitors, you may also need a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >webcam recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that has the ability to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record 4K videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> too, such as Filmora <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Screen Recorder Software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>The RightLight 3 with HDR functionality does mean that you will get the sharpest, most accurate videos out there</strong>. But until the software and hardware that support 4K are widely available the ultra-high-resolution aspect of the camera will not be immediately useful.</p><p>Therefore, you should get the Logitech 44K Pro takes the best shots you’ll get right now if you can put-up with the mount which is a huge step down from previous models. But right now, there’s limited usability for such a futuristic webcam and Logitech makes cheaper alternatives that can shoot HD videos, such as the C920 and the C922.K Pro Webcam if you’re a YouTuber who wants to live stream super-sharp videos at the highest resolution possible. Or, if you’re a forward-thinking type and have the budget to get ahead of the curve.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Work at home is a term we have been hearing now, a lot more than never before. But the easy availability of internet, advancement in technology and development of online applications like Skype have enabled a large number of people to be able to carry out their work from home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/from-internet.jpg"                      alt="from-internet"                ></p><p>Image source: <a class="link"   href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/microsoft-skype-for-business" >TechRadar reviews <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Apart from video calls, online meetings or group conversations, Skype also has a Share Screen feature which is very useful for all the people that work from home. The share screen on Skype allows you to share the screen of your PC as a live video while you operate, with any other person you are on call with. Imagine the benefits of this feature! An easy demonstration of work or work progress to your fellow mates who are far away, as if they were sitting just beside you. Skype has made working from home easier than ever, provided you have an internet connection.</p><p>Now let us see how your screen can be shared using Skype. You will learn:</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1:</strong> <strong>How to Share Screen on Skype</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2:</strong> <strong>A Live Recording for Screen Sharing on Skype</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="How-to-Share-Screen-on-Skype"><a href="#How-to-Share-Screen-on-Skype" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Screen on Skype"></a>How to Share Screen on Skype</h2><p>Here we will learn how your PC screen can be shared as a live video with another person through Skype. Before sharing, please check your window once to makes sure that you don’t have anything that you wish to be shared with the other person.</p><p>Note:</p><p>Once sharing the screen is started all your activities on the screen will be shown to the other person.</p><ul><li>1. Open Skype and start a video or audio call with the person you want to share your screen with</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-the-person.png"                      alt="find-the-person"                ></p><ul><li>2. While on the call, tap the <strong>+</strong> button on the screen and click the <strong>Share screens…</strong> option</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/click-share-screen.jpg"                      alt="click-share-screen"                ></p><ul><li>3. A preview of your present screen will appear under which there will be two options, Cancel and Share Screen. Tap on the <strong>Share Screen</strong> option to continue</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-share-screen.jpg"                      alt="start-share-screen"                ></p><ul><li>4. Now the person on the other side will be able to view all that is on the screen and all the functions you are going to perform on the screen including the programs you are going to open</li></ul><p>Note:</p><p>The person will only be able to view the activities you perform but won’t be able to access your files in any way.</p><ul><li>5. Once you are done, to stop sharing the screen tap again on the <strong>+</strong> button and click on the Stop sharing option</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stop-sharing.jpg"                      alt="stop-sharing"                ></p><p>The screen sharing session will be ended and you will be able to continue on the voice or video call without sharing your screen.</p><h2 id="A-Live-Recording-for-Screen-Sharing-on-Skype"><a href="#A-Live-Recording-for-Screen-Sharing-on-Skype" class="headerlink" title="A Live Recording for Screen Sharing on Skype"></a>A Live Recording for Screen Sharing on Skype</h2><p>What if you want to record a video of your screen sharing on Skype with your fellow mate? Skype does not have such a feature and you will have to depend on other applications like Filmora, which is one of the best and widely used video editing applications in the market.</p><p>The screen recorder in Filmora allows you to record the screen of your desktop including the audio and save it on your computer.</p><p>Here we will be discussing how the screen record function works on Windows.</p><p>Note:</p><p>Start recording on Filmora before you start sharing the screen on Skype if you don’t want the other person to know that you are recording.</p><ul><li>1. <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Download Filmora from here</strong></a> , then open it and click New Project to enter the editing mode</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/launch-filmora9.jpg"                      alt="launch-filmora9"                ></p><ul><li>2.

The built-in screen recorder will pop up</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-record-pc-screen-2.jpg"                      alt="filmora-record-pc-screen-2"                ></p><ul><li>4. You can go to the recording settings by the Settings icon, and set the hotkeys for your recording. Or you can also enable the option by checking the Record the Camera Stream to record your webcam simultaneously and also adjust the frame rate.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-settings.jpg"                      alt="record-settings"                ></p><ul><li>5. Once you are done with the settings, Click the Red button to start the recording.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-record-pc-screen-4.jpg"                      alt="filmora-record-pc-screen-4"                ></p><ul><li>6. Now you can call your mate and start video sharing on Skype. The whole screen sharing process will be recorded by Filmora. After you finish the recording, the recorded file will show up in the media library automatically. You can right-click it, select <strong>Reveal in Explorer</strong> to target it on your Desktop folders.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-recorded-file.jpg"                      alt="find-recorded-file"                ></p><p>Note:</p><p>The steps to record screen on Mac are similar to Windows.</p><h4 id="To-Sum-up"><a href="#To-Sum-up" class="headerlink" title="To Sum up"></a>To Sum up</h4><p>The use of applications like Skype and Filmora has made working from home easier than ever before.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="TransferGenius-Gurus’-Viewpoint"><a href="#TransferGenius-Gurus’-Viewpoint" class="headerlink" title="TransferGenius Gurus’ Viewpoint"></a>TransferGenius Gurus’ Viewpoint</h2><p>EaseUS RecExperts is a screen recording program for Windows that allows users to capture a complete screen or a select area of it, as well as record narrator voice or system noises and improve the overall quality of the individual clip. Within a PC, the system may be utilized to create professional-looking films. Camera video recording is supported by EaseUS RecExperts, allowing users to shoot movies inside the webcam or as an overlay, allowing for higher levels of involvement. You may record the whole screen, a specific region, or even a locked window with EaseUS RecExperts. Additionally, while recording, you may annotate your screen, label an area, and do other editing activities. You can rapidly export or distribute your recording to various platforms, depending on your preferences.</p><p>EaseUS RecExperts is a multi-purpose but simple-to-use Windows screen recorder that allows you to record and capture everything on your computer’s screen. Thanks to its simple and well-organized interface, you can get started quickly. You may record your screen, audio, and camera independently or all at once. In addition, the game recording option enables you to record your games in whatever way you desire. Annotation, cutting, watermark insertion, and other sophisticated editing tools are included in the program. The recordings may be exported in a variety of file formats, including MP4, AVI, and WMV. They may even upload the created video to YouTube immediately. Noise reduction and audio enhancement are also included in the software’s capabilities. It comes with its game recording mode, capable of capturing popular 2D&#x2F;3D games in 4K UHD quality. Users may use the built-in task planner to complete their recording tasks on time and in an automatic manner.</p><h2 id="1-Price-and-Tech-Specifications"><a href="#1-Price-and-Tech-Specifications" class="headerlink" title="1. Price and Tech Specifications"></a>1. Price and Tech Specifications</h2><p>EaseUS RecExperts cost $11.97 a month, $23.97 a year, or $69.95 for the rest of your life. A single license for one machine is included in this price. It’s worth noting that you can test out the program for free. The trial version restricts you to two-minute recordings and adds a watermark to your movies.</p><p>Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and Mac OS are all supported by EaseUS RecExperts. Initially, EaseUS Screen Recorder was only available for Windows, but a Mac OS version was eventually published. The program will be installed as a standalone app on your system disk. There are no further add-ons required. When recording games, RecExperts also allows you to alter the frame rate up to 60 frames per second. RecExperts is starting to look like a first-class application for all kinds of on-screen recording requirements, with the ability to output to 10+ commonly used recording formats (including MP4, MOV, and MP3), the ability to make GIFs directly from screen captures, and the ability to automatically stop and split recordings based on time or file size limits.</p><h2 id="2-How-to-Use-RecExperts"><a href="#2-How-to-Use-RecExperts" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Use RecExperts"></a>2. How to Use RecExperts</h2><p>EaseUS RecExperts is a premium screen recording software for Windows and Mac OS created by EaseUS.com. It’s a multi-purpose screen recorder that can do both screen recording and Webcam recording. RecExperts may also record full-screen or a specific part of the screen. The free trial version of RecExperts can be downloaded fast and conveniently from the EaseUS website, and the installation can be started right away.</p><p>Step 1: Launch EaseUS RecExperts</p><p>As can be seen in the screenshot below, the first function that is pre-selected for us when we launch the RecExperts program is the one that is necessary for capturing the complete default computer display. We have simple access to all of the software’s key functionalities as well as the main settings menu for modifying, among other things, the default file formats utilized, from this main program window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/easeus-recexperts.jpg"                      alt="easeus recexperts"                ></p><p>Step 2: Setup the Recording</p><p>For improved content distribution, you may record the single Webcam or use the Webcam as an overlay on a movie. With simplicity, you may pick full-screen recording, a specific portion of the screen, or a single window. Simply pressing the orange “REC” button will start the recording process; the main program windows will vanish at this point, being replaced by a smaller control window, as seen below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-setup-the-recording.jpg"                      alt="setup the recording"                ></p><p>Step 3: Finish&#x2F;Save Recording</p><p>We may finish the recording by clicking the red “stop” button after the screen recording is complete (which will, by default, include any sound outputted by the device during this process). When the recording is finished and the stop button is pushed, the RecExperts program will open the freshly recorded clip in the RecExperts editing suite, where we may continue to work with the material:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-recoring.jpg"                      alt="save recording"                ></p><h2 id="3-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#3-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="3. Pros and Cons"></a>3. Pros and Cons</h2><p>EaseUS RecExperts is one of the finest screen recorders available whether you’re producing webinars or need to record movies on your PC. This powerful program lets you capture a portion of your screen, overlay video from a camera, and record audio on top of it all. RecExperts supports 4K recording and includes several useful tools to enhance the impact of your films.</p><p>**<strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio and video from the webcam are captured.</li><li>An automated recording is supported.</li><li>Video quality, frame rate, and audio bitrate may all be adjusted.</li><li>GPU-assisted hardware acceleration is supported.</li><li>(Basic) video editing tools built-in</li><li>The picture formats BMP, JPG, PNG, GIF, and TIFF are all supported by EaseUS Screen Recorder.</li><li>Recordings may be used to extract screenshots or audio samples.</li><li>Support for ten distinct output file types is complete.</li><li>EaseUS RecExperts supports video formats MP4, WMV, AVI, MOV, FLV, and ASF, as well as audio formats MP3.</li></ul><p>**<strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>The editing options are limited.</li><li>A little bit pricey</li></ul><h2 id="4-Alternative-to-RecExperts"><a href="#4-Alternative-to-RecExperts" class="headerlink" title="4. Alternative to RecExperts"></a>4. Alternative to RecExperts</h2><p>RecExperts is no doubt, a fantastic <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording program <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with excellent customer service. Filmora, on the other hand, maybe of interest if you want additional bells and whistles. RecExperts Screen Recorder has compiled a list of reasons why you should look into screen recorder software. It is a useful screen recording app for Windows 10&#x2F;8.2.8&#x2F;7&#x2F;XP that allows you to capture any movement in any size. We can capture the screen using screen projection software, but it isn’t enough to generate a convincing movie or YouTube video instructive lesson. We’ll need video recording and editing software that can provide a clear screen recording for this. This is why we looked at Wondershare Filmora, a video recorder and editor available for both Windows and Mac OS.</p><p>Wondershare Filmora’s video recording and editing software comes with a comprehensive range of video capture and editing features, making it the finest alternative to RecExperts screen recorder software. Filmora allows you complete control over everything from the screen’s size to how you capture and edit video. Not only that, but it also allows you to upload media files, record the screen with sound, export movies to MP4, WMV, AVI, MOV, GIF, MP3, modify video effects, Bitrate, Frame rate, and change the sound when transmitting to the online community. This keeps your movie looking neat while keeping it interesting. You may generate a green screen effect, make adjustments, add stickers, subtitles, add comments, cursor effects, notes, callouts, trim video, denoise it, increment, fade-in&#x2F;fade-out volume, and much more after the screen is selected for recording and recorded.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Record-with-Filmora"><a href="#Steps-to-Record-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="**Steps to Record with Filmora:"></a>**<strong>Steps to Record with Filmora:</strong></h3><p>Step 1.

To do so, go to the Start New Recording button in the start-up box, and the recorder will open as follows:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/recording-01.png"                      alt="launch the recorder"                ></p><p>Step 3.Customize the Source of Recording</p><p>With the integrated options in Filmora’s recorder, you may completely modify your recordings.

Alternative to RecExperts</h2><p>RecExperts is no doubt, a fantastic <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording program <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with excellent customer service. Filmora, on the other hand, maybe of interest if you want additional bells and whistles. RecExperts Screen Recorder has compiled a list of reasons why you should look into screen recorder software. It is a useful screen recording app for Windows 10&#x2F;8.2.8&#x2F;7&#x2F;XP that allows you to capture any movement in any size. We can capture the screen using screen projection software, but it isn’t enough to generate a convincing movie or YouTube video instructive lesson. We’ll need video recording and editing software that can provide a clear screen recording for this. This is why we looked at Wondershare Filmora, a video recorder and editor available for both Windows and Mac OS.</p><p>Wondershare Filmora’s video recording and editing software comes with a comprehensive range of video capture and editing features, making it the finest alternative to RecExperts screen recorder software. Filmora allows you complete control over everything from the screen’s size to how you capture and edit video. Not only that, but it also allows you to upload media files, record the screen with sound, export movies to MP4, WMV, AVI, MOV, GIF, MP3, modify video effects, Bitrate, Frame rate, and change the sound when transmitting to the online community. This keeps your movie looking neat while keeping it interesting. You may generate a green screen effect, make adjustments, add stickers, subtitles, add comments, cursor effects, notes, callouts, trim video, denoise it, increment, fade-in&#x2F;fade-out volume, and much more after the screen is selected for recording and recorded.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DBanner%2B728x90"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/2e76fe6a-3010-1b37-7846-f34ff9c6b4ca.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Steps-to-Record-with-Filmora-3"><a href="#Steps-to-Record-with-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="**Steps to Record with Filmora:"></a>**<strong>Steps to Record with Filmora:</strong></h3><p>Step 1.

Learn all the essential elements and steps to record voice over like professionals.</p><p>For every video you come across, the audio part is equally important as the visual part. Even when the visual part is top-notch, if the audio part such as background music and the voice narration is not good enough, you lose interest in the video. Therefore, you have to pay equal attention to the video recording as well as voiceover recording. A voiceover is basically a person speaking in the background as the video is playing along to make proper sense as well as to add more context to the video.</p><p>A voiceover recording can be describing the video, explaining concepts, highlighting important points, and likewise. Generally, a voiceover is added to the video after the video is already recorded. In order to record a good voice over, there are certain essential elements you need to have beforehand. In this article, we will explain why and how to record a voice over and how to make a voice over good to get everyone’s attention and appreciation.</p><h2 id="1-Why-To-Record-A-Voiceover"><a href="#1-Why-To-Record-A-Voiceover" class="headerlink" title="1. Why To Record A Voiceover?"></a>1. Why To Record A Voiceover?</h2><p>The engagement on a video depends both on how good the video content as well as how good the audio is. The audio in a video is not just about background music. A good voiceover can do wonders in terms of retaining the attention of the viewers as well as showcasing your personality traits.</p><p>A voice over recording is a must when you are making instructional, educational, and informational videos. Imagine watching a tutorial video where there is no voice to explain what is happening on the screen, everyone will leave the video immediately. Therefore, a voiceover essentially explains the video so that everyone can understand and even relate properly.</p><h2 id="2-Essential-elements-for-a-good-voice-over"><a href="#2-Essential-elements-for-a-good-voice-over" class="headerlink" title="2. Essential elements for a good voice over"></a>2. Essential elements for a good voice over</h2><p>You have to ensure that your voice over recording is great from all perspectives. There are certain essential elements that you have to get right in order to make a voice over mediocre to good and even great.</p><p><strong>Audio Clarity</strong></p><p>Every great voiceover has perfect voice quality and comfortable volume. Audiences may find it distracting if the voiceover recording has a muddy and muffled sound. They will definitely miss the important message that you may want to share through the video. Low volume will make people difficult to hear whereas too loud can cause irritation.</p><p>To ensure audio clarity, professionals use voice over recording studio. If you generally record voice over at home, make sure you do it when there is absolute silence in the background. Besides, the mic quality should be top-notch to pick your voice only as close to original and eliminate background noise.</p><p><strong>Pacing of Pitch</strong></p><p>Pacing is the speed of how fast or slow your pitch is. If you go too fast, your audience will not be able to catch you. On the contrary, the slow pace can be boring. It is important to have a natural pace for everyone to understand as well as stay interested. Therefore, maintain a good pace throughout the video but take pauses to add audio effects. Pauses are a part of pacing for allowing the listeners to grab information and for you to breathe properly so that mic does not catch it.</p><p><strong>Vocal Tone</strong></p><p>Vocal tone is about speaking in a pleasant, soothing but natural manner. You need to make sure that the tone has to be engaging but friendly. Sometimes, you may have to fake it but it must not sound fake or boring for the listeners. A proper vocal tone comes with regular practice and experimentation.</p><p><strong>Pronunciation</strong></p><p>Always make sure that you pronounce every word correctly. The listeners must clearly understand what you speak clearly. Avoid mumbling, over-enunciating, and shouting. At times, you may have to avoid your regional accent to make the audience understand with more clarity. Always ask feedback from listeners to be better at pronouncing certain words.</p><h2 id="3-How-To-Record-A-Voice-Over"><a href="#3-How-To-Record-A-Voice-Over" class="headerlink" title="3. How To Record A Voice Over?"></a>3. How To Record A Voice Over?</h2><p>Here are the steps to follow to record voiceover properly like professionals.</p><p><strong>Getting Ready</strong></p><ul><li>Location: Look for a quiet place to work. Professional voice artists opt for a soundproof room to cancel out external noise. However, you can even go for a quiet area where there is no distracting noise. Microphones can pick up ambient noise that will be reflected in the voiceover recording. Apart from human conversations, you will also have to be careful of the sound coming from electronic gadgets such as computer fans.</li><li>Microphone: Look for a top-notch microphone as per your budget. Consider using a pop filter if you are going to use an external mic. It helps to reduce the distracting sounds with certain alphabets as well as the sound of breathing. Among affordable microphones, you may use modern earbuds or headphones with mic that you use for your smartphone. There are many USB microphones available in the market at an affordable value.</li><li>Voiceover Recorder Software: You need a good-quality audio recording software to record voiceover as well as edit the recording as per requirement. There are many free as well as premium audio recording software available in the market today. We recommend Wondershare Filmora as you can record voice over for any video like professionals as well as edit the recording of audio and video in the same software.</li></ul><p><strong>Writing A Proper Script</strong></p><p>The best way to sound professional during a voice over is to use a proper script. When you don’t use a script, then there can be a lot of pauses and you may try to think about what you will have to say next. When you use a script, you have everything planned out beforehand. Besides, you can also practice what to say when you have a script with pointers and even full explanation of each point. Try to read the script many times and be careful of the words and phrases that can be awkward. Adjust the script accordingly so that it will fit perfectly in the recording.</p><p><strong>Performing A Test Recording</strong></p><p>It is always advisable to go for a test recording to ensure that everything is working properly. In a test recording, you don’t have to go for the entire script but just a few paragraphs. Check if the audio is clear, the volume is at the right level, and the recording is seamless. Check the audio quality by using headphones and not computer speakers.</p><p>**<strong>Microphone Placement</strong> - If you keep the microphone too close to the mouth, there will be all kinds of weird sounds including air puffs. Too far placement will make your voice get fainted. The perfect placement should be about 6 to 8 inches from the mouth and it has to be slightly below the chin. Check the test recording carefully as some microphones can pick up sounds from the table and the computer.</p><p><strong>Recording Voice Over</strong></p><p>So by now, you have the video for which you want to record voiceover.

This is somewhat similar to what people did back in the Yahoo! Messenger era. However, unlike Yahoo! Messenger, Zoom doesn’t have open rooms where users could find new friends. Instead, it allows to chat only with those who are connected to each other through a conference call.</p><p>When talking about the chat configurations, all the contextual options can be accessed by clicking the <strong>Settings</strong> (<strong>Gear</strong>) icon from the top-right corner of the Zoom window, and selecting the <strong>Chat</strong> category from the left bar of the <strong>Settings</strong> window that opens up next.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-setting.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Settings icon"                ></p><p>Once there, following are the options that you can configure to secure your <strong>Zoom chat</strong> experience:</p><ul><li><strong>Active Status</strong></li></ul><p>Checked by default, the <strong>Change my status to “Away” when I am inactive for</strong> ‘n’ <strong>minutes</strong> lets you automatically change your active status to <strong>Away</strong> when Zoom doesn’t detect any input from you for a certain amount of time. The inactive time threshold can be configured by entering a value in the available box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-settings.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat Settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unblocking</strong></li></ul><p>The <strong>Manage blocked users</strong> button next to the <strong>Blocked users</strong> label lets you view the list all the users you have blocked. The <strong>Unblock</strong> button at the bottom of the <strong>Blocked users</strong> box allows you to unblock the users for chatting.</p><ul><li><strong>Push Notifications</strong></li></ul><p>The radio buttons under this section let you choose which type of chat messages can trigger push notifications so they are flashed on your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-notification-settings.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat Nofitications Settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Other Notifications</strong></li></ul><p>The <strong>Keywords</strong> button next to the <strong>Receive notifications for</strong> label lets you define the keywords in the chat messages that can trigger notifications.</p><ul><li><strong>DND</strong></li></ul><p>The <strong>Do not disturb from</strong> checkbox allows you to define the duration of the day when Zoom won’t notify you about any chat messages.</p><ul><li><strong>Message Previews</strong></li></ul><p>When the <strong>Show message preview</strong> box is unchecked, Zoom prevents the text of the chat messages from appearing on the screen, and you must open the message to view its content.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Chat-in-Zoom"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Chat-in-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Chat in Zoom"></a>Part 2: How to Chat in Zoom</h2><p>When it comes to texting there are several options available for you to choose <strong>how to chat in Zoom</strong>. For instance, you can send a message to everyone in the chat or send a private message to one of the participants, mention participant(s) while typing a message, and can even send a file to them if need be. You can learn how to do all these by following their corresponding methods given below:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087407/7443" target="_top" id="2087407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087407"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="500"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-How-to-Mention-People-in-Zoom-Chat"><a href="#1-How-to-Mention-People-in-Zoom-Chat" class="headerlink" title="1.

While the first two steps explain how to enable the <strong>Announcements</strong> feature and add the users who can send or receive announcements, the third step teaches how to send announcements to all the users you added.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Enable-Announcements"><a href="#Step-1-Enable-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enable Announcements"></a>Step 1: Enable Announcements</h4><p>Launch your favorite browser, sign in to the web portal of your Zoom account, go to <strong>Account Management</strong> &gt; <strong>IM Management</strong> &gt; <strong>IM Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Visibility</strong> and then turn on the <strong>Announcements</strong> switch.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Add-Users-for-Announcements"><a href="#Step-2-Add-Users-for-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Add Users for Announcements"></a>Step 2: Add Users for Announcements</h4><p>Click the <strong>+</strong> icon, in the available field type the email address(es) of the user(s) you want to allow to send or receive the announcements and click <strong>Add</strong> to add the participant(s) once found.

Can Zoom host see private chats?"></a><strong>Q) Is Zoom chat secure, safe, and encrypted? Can Zoom host see private chats?</strong></h4><p><strong>A) Yes and No.</strong></p><p>To answer the first question, Zoom chats are encrypted. However, the encryption is disabled by default and must be enabled by turning on the <strong>Require Encryption for 3rd Party Endpoints (H323&#x2F;SIP)</strong> switch from the <strong>In Meeting (Basic)</strong> section.</p><p>Tips</p><p>As a video call host, if you don’t want the participant to save the chat content, you should enable <strong>Prevent participants from saving chat</strong> and save the changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-prevent-participants-from-saving-chat.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat  Saving Settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aspironcom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1941789/21554" target="_top" id="1941789"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21554-1941789"                      border="0" alt="" width="650" height="800"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1941789/21554"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Furthermore, if you have a paid subscription of Zoom, you can use advanced encryption method that is available on the <strong>IM Management</strong> page on your account’s web portal. About the second question, the host cannot see the private messages that the participants send to each other during a meeting session.</p><h4 id="Q-Can-people-see-my-chat-when-I-am-screen-sharing"><a href="#Q-Can-people-see-my-chat-when-I-am-screen-sharing" class="headerlink" title="Q) Can people see my chat when I am screen sharing?"></a><strong>Q) Can people see my chat when I am screen sharing?</strong></h4><p>A) No.</p><p>As long as you are chatting using <strong>Zoom chat</strong>, other participants cannot see your conversation. However, if there is something else on your screen such as your Facebook profile&#x2F;chat, your email account, or your bank account’s page, all those windows can be viewed by the participants you are sharing your screen with.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong>Zoom chat</strong> is an easy way to converse with the participants in case there are some typical words that need to be spelled or some files to be shared. These chats are not only encrypted, they can also be controlled by the host so that the participants can send messages only to the host, to each other, or to no one at all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958379/18409" target="_top" id="1958379"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958379"                      border="0" alt="" width="856" height="508"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1958379/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-2023s-best-mobile-emulators-top-choices-for-your-classic-psp-adventures/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  2023'S Best Mobile Emulators  Top Choices for Your Classic PSP Adventures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-android-device-capture-free-simplify-your-tech-life/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Android Device Capture - FREE!
