The 4K Pro is the first mass-market 4K webcam in the world. It is also loaded with extra features to produce beautiful videos, far surpassing the needs of most users. Although Skype and Messenger users might not find the 4K Pro cost-effective ($199!) tech enthusiasts and pro-streamers will. Because what the 4K Pro offers is a glimpse into the 4K future!</p><p>In this article we will provide a comprehensive review of this Logitech 4K webcam, breaking it down to the essentials, so you can decide if this is the gadget for your YouTube streaming or video recordings.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Hardware Specification Glimpse</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Logitech 4K Webcam Design Review</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Picture and Sound Quality Test</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Logitech 4K Webcam main features</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Logitech 4K Webcam Recording Capabilities Test</a></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logitech-4k-pro-webcam.jpg"                      alt=" Logitech 4K Webcam "                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Logitech’s-4K-Pro-camera-Hardware-Specification"><a href="#Part-1-Logitech’s-4K-Pro-camera-Hardware-Specification" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Logitech’s 4K Pro camera Hardware Specification"></a>Part 1: Logitech’s 4K Pro camera Hardware Specification</h2><p>The Logitech 4K Pro features <strong>4K Ultra HD streaming up to 4096 x 2160 pixels at 30 FPS</strong>. It also streams 1080p Full HD at either 30 FPS or 60 FPs and 720p HD at 30, 60 and 90 FPS. This range of options is essential because, without a monitor that supports 4K Ultra HD, you won’t be able to use the 4K Pro’s 4K capabilities. <strong>Logitech’s RightLight 3 with HDR</strong> further enhances the video, allowing for streaming in various lighting environments ranging from direct sunlight to low-light.</p><p>It also has <strong>plug-and-play capabilities</strong>, with USB 2.0 Type A and USB 3.0 Type A and C connectivity. It has the best out-of-the-box settings we’ve seen in a webcam. However, to get the most out the 4K Pro you need to <strong>download the Logitech Camera Settings app from Logitech’s website</strong>. The app makes available all the 4K Pro’s camera controls such as pan and 5x digital zoom in Full HD as well as the ability to calibrate brightness, contrast and white balance. It also lets you choose between standard and widescreen displays or change the field of view (FOV) from 90 degrees to 78 or 65 degrees.</p><p>The Logitech also has a <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Background Replacement Feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, enabled through a separate download, and <strong>built-in dual omnidirectional mics with automatic background noise cancellation</strong>.</p><p>The camera’s system requirements are Windows 7 (1080p only), Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and masOS 10.10 or higher. For Chromebooks, it requires Version 29.0.1547.70, Platform 4319.79.0 with a 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Dual Processor and 2 GB of RAM.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/977686/11832" target="_top" id="977686">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-977686" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/977686/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Compact-Design"><a href="#Part-2-Compact-Design" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Compact Design"></a>Part 2: Compact Design</h2><p>The 4K Pro manages to fit all those features into a slim design. <strong>It’s just</strong> <strong>4 x 1.1 x 1.1-inches</strong>. Because of its aluminium casing, it is also light, weighing just two ounces. The 4K Pro’s layout is simple, with the 4K lens in the centre between the two omnidirectional, noise-cancelling microphones.</p><p>The unit is mounted to a rubber-coated flexible arm that can clip onto the top of a laptop or flat-screen monitor. The rubber arm allows the camera to be tilted and contorted for greater customisation. <strong>Unfortunately, the 4K Pro’s mount is a step-down in build quality from the C920 and C922</strong>. Logitech’s webcams usually have some of the best clips in the business, because they are made of hard plastic that locks them tight against your screen. The 4K Pro’s arm takes a little getting used to and it can wobble and even fall off if you’re not careful. However, I can understand why Logitech made the change. The 4K Pro’s arm is detachable and reveals a square plastic piece on the bottom of the stand which folds out, allowing the camera to stand freely on any flat surface. Alternatively, the stand can be removed to place the camera on a tripod mount.</p><p><strong>The 4K Pros 4.9-feet cable is also detachable</strong>, so you can replace it with a more compatible connector of your choosing. There are two accessories included with the 4K Pro. A plastic privacy shutter that clips over the camera unit with a small-hinged flap that can be lowered over the lens when you’re not using it. As well as a microfiber drawstring bag to transport the 4K Pro in.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-is-the-Picture-and-Sound-Quality-recorded-by-Logitech-4K-Webcam"><a href="#Part-3-How-is-the-Picture-and-Sound-Quality-recorded-by-Logitech-4K-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How is the Picture and Sound Quality recorded by Logitech 4K Webcam?"></a>Part 3: How is the Picture and Sound Quality recorded by Logitech 4K Webcam?</h2><p><strong>There’s no question Logitech’s 4K Pro takes the best-looking pictures out of all the external webcams on the market</strong>. Its unparalleled quality is enhanced by Logitech’s RightLight 3 with HDR technology, allowing it to adjust to all lighting environments; whether it be under fluorescent lighting or natural light. Recordings are wide-screen, with real-to-life colours and sharp details. <strong>Thanks to the wide 90-degree lens, it also captures more of the background then its competitors</strong>. However, as mentioned in the specifications section, you have to download the Logitech Camera Settings App to unlock all the 4K Pro’s features.</p><p><strong>The dual omnidirectional microphones produce crystal clear sound</strong>. The automatic background noise-cancellation worked well in all environments and the recorded audio was nice and loud.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-effective-are-the-main-features-of-the-4K-Webcam"><a href="#Part-4-How-effective-are-the-main-features-of-the-4K-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How effective are the main features of the 4K Webcam?"></a>Part 4: How effective are the main features of the 4K Webcam?</h2><p>As mentioned in the specifications section, there’s an optional Background Replacement Feature, which is powered by Personify. The feature is in its beta stage, which is why it’s not built into the app. Instead, you need to download an extra driver to get it to work. <strong>But despite being in beta, the Background Replacement Feature works really, really well</strong>.</p><p>There’s a cool new feature, which I have not seen on other webcams, that blurs the background to keep out the details you might want to keep hidden! The Chromakey pre-set green-screen background is <strong>great for game streaming on Twitch or YouTube</strong>.</p><p><strong>The 4K Pro also uses an infrared camera to support facial recognition to log in via Windows Hello</strong>. This is such a cutting-edge and exciting feature and it worked well regardless of the lighting environment.</p><p>Also, once you have downloaded the Logitech Camera Settings App it is very easy to customise your videos. The multiple field-of-vision options and 5x digital zoom allow you to take control of the shot and are fantastic integrations for video-conferencing.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424529">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424529.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424529">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424529.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424529%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424529/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-How-About-the-4K-Webcam-Recording-Capabilities"><a href="#Part-5-How-About-the-4K-Webcam-Recording-Capabilities" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How About the 4K Webcam Recording Capabilities?"></a>Part 5: How About the 4K Webcam Recording Capabilities?</h2><p><strong>Right now, there aren’t many ways you can use the Logitech 4K Pro at its full 4K resolution.</strong> The issue is that 4K Ultra HD has yet to make the kind of impact in the online market that it has in home entertainment. The most popular video-chatting apps, including Google Hangouts and Skype for Business, don’t support 4K. <strong>You’ll also need a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4k Monitor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to truly appreciate the picture</strong> and if who you’re chatting to online doesn’t have one, then they’ll only see you in 1080p. You can stream 4K videos to YouTube if you have enough bandwidth. Besides the 4K monitors, you may also need a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >webcam recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that has the ability to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record 4K videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> too, such as Filmora <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Screen Recorder Software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>The RightLight 3 with HDR functionality does mean that you will get the sharpest, most accurate videos out there</strong>. But until the software and hardware that support 4K are widely available the ultra-high-resolution aspect of the camera will not be immediately useful.</p><p>Therefore, you should get the Logitech 44K Pro takes the best shots you’ll get right now if you can put-up with the mount which is a huge step down from previous models. But right now, there’s limited usability for such a futuristic webcam and Logitech makes cheaper alternatives that can shoot HD videos, such as the C920 and the C922.K Pro Webcam if you’re a YouTuber who wants to live stream super-sharp videos at the highest resolution possible. Or, if you’re a forward-thinking type and have the budget to get ahead of the curve.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

The PlayStation 2 was released to compete with Nintendo’s SNES, which ruled the console video-gaming market for years. Sony launched its first-ever gaming console after years of reorganizations and partnerships, including ones with Nintendo. The console was immensely successful until its successor replaced it.</p><p>With the PS1 emulator for PC, you can play PlayStation 1 games. Play your favorite PlayStation games on your computer with the original BIOS, your own BIOS, and your own games. Listed below, you will find some of the best PS1 emulators that will allow you to relive those days. If you have an original game disk, even better. All you need is a copy of the disc image.</p><h3 id="1-RetroArch-Emulator"><a href="#1-RetroArch-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="1.RetroArch Emulator"></a>1.RetroArch Emulator</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/retroarch-emulator-ps1.png"                      alt="retroarch-emulator-ps1"                ></p><p>This emulator offers a variety of solutions and is just an emulator for playing PS1 video games, making it one of the best ps 1 emulators and most complete emulators. The first stable version was released in the year 2020, almost a decade after its launch in the year 2010. On top of all that, it is free, open-source, and can emulate gaming consoles, media players, game engines, and others. That makes it a very reliable emulator.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Multiple platforms are supported, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.</li><li>As a fast, portable, lightweight emulator, RetroArch requires no adjustments or very little tweaking to run and function properly.</li><li>In terms of game-saving, refresh rate, game loading, and screen resolution, it is one of the best PS1 emulators out there.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Matsu-Emulator"><a href="#2-Matsu-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="2.Matsu Emulator"></a>2.Matsu Emulator</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/matsu-emulator-ps1.png"                      alt="matsu-emulator-ps1"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/798161/11305" target="_top" id="798161">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-798161" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i110150.net/i/5597632/798161/11305"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>There is also the Matsu Emulator, which is based on the PSX&#x2F;PSOne platform.

Key Features of Ezvid"></a>1. Key Features of Ezvid</h2><p>Ezvid video maker is a great screen recording software and here are the features that the software has to offer to satisfy all the requirements of the video creators.</p><p><strong>Record Screen and Facecam</strong></p><p>Ezvid is an incredible screen recorder to capture your desktop screen as well as browser screen. The user interface is clean and there is a direct option available to start recording the entire screen. Moreover, there are advanced options available such as capturing a region of the screen instead of the entire screen.</p><p>Besides, you can record Facecam which is extremely important for video creators who show the screen as well as their face on the same video simultaneously. This makes the video more relatable and professional. Therefore, apart from recording the entire or part of the screen, you can record from the webcam and both the capturing is put together in the same video.</p><p><strong>Instant Screen Drawing</strong></p><p>Instead of waiting for the screen recording to get over and editing the recorded video to add drawings, you can add the required drawings live while recording the screen with Ezvid screen recorder. This simple feature is going to save you a lot of time as there is no further editing required. There are ample drawings available to illustrate on the screen and draw the attention of the viewers in the highlighted areas.</p><p><strong>Gameplay Recording</strong></p><p>Apart from recording desktop screen as well as browser screen, there is a special and dedicated feature to capture the screen while playing games. The software comes with guided instructions on how to record gameplay for complete user convenience. Professional gamers may not get all the customization options but Ezvid gets the job done perfectly. After recording the game screen, you can edit the video and upload it on social media and video streaming platforms.</p><p><strong>Free Music Addition</strong></p><p>One of the main reasons why a good-quality video stands out from a basic video is the background music. You will find only a few screen recorders and video editors to add free music in the background of the video as per your preference and requirements. This makes the video soothing and pleasant to the ears rather than just being pleasant to the eyes. There is no need to search online for free music to add to your screen recordings as you can find suitable music for your video from Ezvid library.</p><p><strong>Control Video Speed</strong></p><p>You know how important it is to regulate video speed so that the crucial moments are recorded at a slow speed while not so important parts can be at a high speed. There are only a few screen recorders available that allow users to control video speed. This is a necessary feature professional video creators always look for in a screen recording and video editing software.</p><p><strong>Instant Slideshow Maker -</strong></p><p>Instead of making and editing videos all the time, you can also use Ezvid to make slideshows using screenshots and photos. There are beautiful transitions and effects available and you can add texts and drawings. You can make the slideshows instantly and share them with anyone on any platform. Therefore, Ezvid video maker can be used as a screen recorder as well as slideshow maker.</p><p>Besides, you can add voice over to the recorded video to make it more professional and interesting.</p><h2 id="2-How-to-Use-Ezvid-Screen-Recorder-3"><a href="#2-How-to-Use-Ezvid-Screen-Recorder-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

Taking Game Screenshots with Game Bar on Windows 10"></a>1. Taking Game Screenshots with Game Bar on Windows 10</h4><p>If you are not interested in installing any additional tool on your gaming PC, it is even possible to capture high-quality game screenshots using Game Bar. While playing an adventure game, you first need to open the game bar; but it is easy to do with keyboard-based shortcuts. Simply press, Windows + Alt + Print Screen or it can also be done by hitting Windows + G keys. As soon as the Game Bar is open on your screen, hit the camera shaped button available on the bar; it is named “Screenshot.”</p><p>In case if you find it little difficult to open your game bar using these keys in between a game; Windows 10 also allows users to customize these keys as per their convenience. You can alter the shortcut keys by switching to Settings, then Gaming and finally Game Bar. As soon as you capture a screenshot using Game Bar, the system shows an instant notification “Screenshot saved,” it appears on the bottom right corner of the screen. All these screenshots are automatically saved at Captures&#x2F; Videos section along with all other videos that you have captured till now using Windows 10 Game Bar feature.</p><h4 id="2-Taking-Screenshots-Using-In-Game-Shortcuts"><a href="#2-Taking-Screenshots-Using-In-Game-Shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="2. Taking Screenshots Using In-Game Shortcuts"></a>2. Taking Screenshots Using In-Game Shortcuts</h4><p>In case if you are not playing games on Steam, it is still possible to capture screenshots with many built-in shortcuts and screenshot functions. In most of the games, the screenshot can be captured instantly using “Print Screen” key; however, few games may follow other settings for screen capture. As soon as you tap the key in question, the game will instantly save a screenshot at a specific location on the disk. For example, in all Blizzard’s Battle.net games, the Print Screen key always helps to capture a screenshot, and they can be later found in a hard drive-based folder. However, the folder name can be different for every game; for example, if you capture a screenshot while playing Overwatch, it will be saved at folder location: Documents\Overwatch\Screenshots\Overwatch. You can perform a web search to know the suitable screenshot key for every game. This information can also be obtained from the shortcut configuration menu.</p><h4 id="3-Taking-Screenshots-Using-Steam’s-Shortcut"><a href="#3-Taking-Screenshots-Using-Steam’s-Shortcut" class="headerlink" title="3. Taking Screenshots Using Steam’s Shortcut"></a>3. Taking Screenshots Using Steam’s Shortcut</h4><p>In case if you are playing your favorite game on Steam, it is possible to capture screenshots instantly by using the built-in screen capture feature of Steam. The great news is that capturing a screenshot with Steam is quite easier; you simply need to hit “F12” key on your keyboard. As soon as you press the key, a shutter sound will be heard on the system and a notification saying “Screenshot Saved” will appear instantly on the bottom right corner of PC screen.</p><p>In case if you do not find F12 key easier to access during your games, you can also customize this key by going to Steam Interface section. Go to settings and then In-Game and finally adjust the “Screenshot Shortcut Keys” option as per your requirement. If you want to view the captured screenshots, open them using Shift + Tab key on Steam Overlay; or if you have altered the settings on Steam, it can be done using your custom shortcut on the keyboard. Finally, click “View Screenshots” button on the overlay.</p><p>If you want to see your screenshots after exiting the game, you will find them on Steam library by opening game page. Simply scroll down towards bottom area of your game’s page, and the screenshots will be available with a “View Screenshot Library” option. You will be happy to know that it is possible to upload captured screenshots directly to Facebook using screenshot library. You can also find your captured screenshots using “Show on Disk” button.</p><h4 id="4-Capturing-Screenshot-with-Nvidia-GeForce-Experience"><a href="#4-Capturing-Screenshot-with-Nvidia-GeForce-Experience" class="headerlink" title="4. Capturing Screenshot with Nvidia GeForce Experience"></a>4. Capturing Screenshot with Nvidia GeForce Experience</h4><p>In case if you are working with Nvidia graphics, the chances are that your system also has Nvidia’s GeForce Experience software. This software tool is loaded with wide range of features and the screenshot capturing ability is one of them. In order to capture a game screenshot with Nvidia GeForce Experience, simply hit Alt + F1 key and the screenshot will get automatically saved into GeForce Experience Gallery. As soon as the screenshot is captured, the system also displays an instant notification about it saying “Screenshot has been saved to Gallery” on the top right side of your screen.</p><p>In order to view the captured screenshots, you can press Alt + Z button on your Windows system. Go to Gallery to view all your game screenshots; note that they will be saved along with the ShadowPlay Videos on your system. These screenshots can also be found under Videos\Name of the Game path along with videos that you have captured using GeForce Experience.</p><h4 id="5-Taking-Screenshot-with-Nvidia-Ansel"><a href="#5-Taking-Screenshot-with-Nvidia-Ansel" class="headerlink" title="5. Taking Screenshot with Nvidia Ansel"></a>5. Taking Screenshot with Nvidia Ansel</h4><p>There is no doubt to say that GeForce Experience provides a rich experience with its awesome features but here is another tool from Nvidia that can also help you to capture screenshots; however, it allows users to capture them using moving camera. Note that, this option works only with few specific games, only if the developer has added support for this feature. However, there are many popular games in the list that support Nvidia Ansel feature like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Middle-Earth: Shadow of War, Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice, Dishonored 2, etc.</p><p>When you are playing the game, simply hit Alt + F2 key and the gameplay will instantly freeze; along with this, “Ansel” sidebar will appear on the screen. Now you can adjust the screen for capturing region specific screenshot using drag and drop feature of a mouse or with the help of keyboard keys. In case if you are interested in adding a unique filter effect to your screenshot, it can be done by using various options available on the sidebar; gamers love to use sepia tone or wish to adjust the field of view for their captured shots. You can also make selections for whether you want to capture your game screenshots with a normal view or need super-resolution. Some of you may also be interested in capturing a 360-degree screenshot with Nvidia Ansel. These 360-degree screenshots can be later viewed via different methods like HTC Vive, Oculus Rift or using Google Cardboard Headset.</p><p>Hit the snap button, and your screenshots will be saved instantly; this system allows you to capture an unlimited number of shots with the paused screen. You can later view these screenshots by pressing Alt + Z key on your system or by simply clicking “Gallery” option. These screenshots are generally saved at Videos\Name of the Game path.</p><h4 id="6-Taking-Game-Screenshots-with-AMD-ReLive-Feature"><a href="#6-Taking-Game-Screenshots-with-AMD-ReLive-Feature" class="headerlink" title="6. Taking Game Screenshots with AMD ReLive Feature"></a>6. Taking Game Screenshots with AMD ReLive Feature</h4><p>In case if you are working on AMD graphics hardware, you can capture screenshots with the help of its ReLive Feature. Note that, this feature works only if you are using a desktop with AMD Graphics Core Next Architecture. However, it is not so fancy like Nvidia Ansel; the screen capture option is almost same as Steam or the Nvidia GeForce Experience. As soon as you are ready with ReLive, simply hit Ctrl + Shift + E button or use Alt + Z. Now click on the “Screenshot” option to capture the screenshot from your favorite game. It will be saved by default into videos folder on your system.
