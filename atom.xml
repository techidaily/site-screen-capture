PDF or TIFF files should only be used if you want to print the screenshot you’ve taken, while the GIF file format is used to create short animations or loops and there is absolutely no reason to use it as a default screenshot file format.</p><h2 id="Which-Screenshot-Format-Should-You-Use"><a href="#Which-Screenshot-Format-Should-You-Use" class="headerlink" title="Which Screenshot Format Should You Use?"></a>Which Screenshot Format Should You Use?</h2><p>Each image file format Mac computer support is designed for different purposes, which is the reason why you should choose the screenshot graphics format that best fits the context in which the file is going to be used. Converting PNG files to some popular file format is almost always necessary, so if you want to avoid having to go through the file conversion process every time you take a screenshot just to be able to edit it, our advice is to set the JPEG as the default screenshot file format on your Mac.</p><p>Besides being smaller in size than PNG files, JPEG files are also handier if you want to annotate the screenshots you’re taking.

In September 2021, PlayStation showcased a packed trailer with Daddy Kratos, foes along the Atreus. The trailer has been trending since the time it was released. Even the first look of the trailer is serving us with too much suspense. The addition of new characters, game details, and plot everything is so on point. Want to know more! Let’s jump to the further details.</p><h2 id="God-of-war-Ragnarok-Release-Date"><a href="#God-of-war-Ragnarok-Release-Date" class="headerlink" title="God of war Ragnarok: Release Date"></a><strong>God of war Ragnarok: Release Date</strong></h2><p>Desperate to know about the God of war Ragnarok Release Date! You reading this is clear proof that you are waiting for this fantastic addition to gameplay. PlayStation studios and Sony Santa announced that Release Date is now shifted from 2021 to 2022. Maybe it’s not a huge surprise for you, but the gameplay is worth waiting for</p><h2 id="God-of-war-Ragnarok-Story"><a href="#God-of-war-Ragnarok-Story" class="headerlink" title="God of war Ragnarok: Story"></a><strong>God of war Ragnarok: Story</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/god-of-war-ragnarok-poster2.jpg"                      alt="god-of-war-ragnarok-poster2"                ></p><p>Now when you are aware from the God of war Ragnarok Release Date, have a look to the storyline. After watching the trailer of God of war Ragnarok, our expectations are pretty high. The game is the ninth entry within the sequel of 2018’s jaw-dropping God of war. God of war was all about ancient Greece to Scandinavia, Kratos against the monsters, and Gods of Norse Mythology. The trailer gave us the idea to expect a more confident and older Atreus, and the next story is going to be based on his giant genes.</p><p>Now, the father and son are the new face of Ragnarok, the Norse version of disaster. Their new journey will be about facing the old enemies from God of War, Freya. New enemies include Thor and Kratos with his son’s rebellious nature. His son is the only one with knowledge about Atreus. The overall story will be based on a total of Nine Realms. Before this, God of War took place in six realms. The latest realms will be Asgard, Svartalfheim, and Vanaheim, along with the previous ones.</p><p>Furthermore, the trailer clarifies that we will see some new characters like Angrboa, who will be one of the last giants in the gameplay. Have you noticed a big guy in the trailer? He is Tyr, the son of Odin and half-brother of Baldur and Thor. But, the son is imprisoned by the father, isn’t it an incredible thrill? If you focus more on the PS5 showcase, you will realize it’s a brief and cryptic teaser. The overall trailer revolves more around the arrival of Ragnarok. In the excitement of “Ragnarok is coming,” most of us are not noticing the game footage. For us, it’s a confirmation of suspense. That background warning of Kratos is not less than an alarm for Atreus and viewers that we should “get ready.” At the end of God of War, we noticed that Kratos’s wife was another mystery; she was the Giant Laufey. This clearly shows that Atreus is Half God and as well as Half-Giant. He has a different name, i.e., Loki. Yes, Loki, the trickster of the Norse Mythology.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/god-of-war-ragnarok-poster3.jpg"                      alt="god-of-war-ragnarok-poster3"                ></p><p>Now, we expect that Ragnarok will explore Faye’s past and the reason she kept it secret. Hopefully, Atreus will get the shape-changing abilities that Loki is currently notorious for. So, Atreus is not just going to be about standing on the sidelines and firing arrows at enemies.</p><h2 id="God-of-War-Ragnarok-is-not-PS5-exclusive"><a href="#God-of-War-Ragnarok-is-not-PS5-exclusive" class="headerlink" title="God of War Ragnarok is not PS5 exclusive"></a><strong>God of War Ragnarok is not PS5 exclusive</strong></h2><p>Along with the God of war Ragnarok Release Date, there is news that the game will not be a PS5 exclusive.

You may use them to produce comprehensive recordings as well as recordings that are limited to a single component or window. The disadvantage is that the free versions of this software sometimes include some very inconvenient restrictions, such as a relatively short time usage or bearing of those annoying presence of watermarks, which might negatively affect the result somewhat.</p><p>We introduce you to an amazing recording software RecordCast by PearlMountain company to record your screen and webcams online. It is a web-based application designed to capture your screen, webcam, and microphone input data. The interface to use the application is very user-friendly. Moreover, it provides free usage capability of up to 5 minutes of maximum recording time. However, for longer recordings, you might need to upgrade them.

It doesn’t upload your content to the web servers instead, it never shares your content with any third party.</p><p>**<strong>Fair Pricing:</strong></p><p>The free version of RecordCast let you record a screen or webcam for a maximum of 5 minutes. However, it can be upgraded to its premium version so you can avail all its features by only paying 2.99 $ per month.

Whether it is a Mac or Windows, you will not have to set up any compatibility settings before using it. This gives it an edge over other similar software.</p><p>**<strong>No Storage:</strong></p><p>Normally, you need to download an application and then install it for its usage.

However, because of the lack of time or morning blues, you did not clean your room and are hesitant to share your screen you can use the blurred background features.</p><p>After starting the Google Meet meeting or entering the password, you can see yourself on the screen. On the bottom right corner, there should appear a silhouette for Windows users. While for Mac users, there will appear three dots. Move the pointer on the silhouette icon or three vertical dots to view the options.</p><p>Google Meet provides its users with three major fun and convenient options for blurred background Google Meet.</p><ul><li>When you click the silhouette with large dots, you can completely blur the background for Google Meet.</li><li>On clicking the silhouette with smaller dots, you have the choice to partially and slightly blur the background for Google Meet.

We could be traveling and take a business call with the help of our iPhone or Android anywhere. There is, however, a minor restriction when it comes to a phone; we cannot choose any background. With mobile, we have only two options to blur the background for Google Meet. Completely blur or slightly blur.</p><p>There will always be glitches and malfunctions in the technical realm, which can usually resolve by restarting the software or device. However, minimum compatibility requirements must be present if you wish to avail blurred background features for Google Meet on your iPhone or Android.</p><p>You need to be having an Android phone with a minimum 9.0 version. For iPhone users, 6s is the minimum requirement for iOS. In addition, your Android smartphone should have 3 GB RAM, ARM64, 4 CPU cores, 1.6 GHz CPU clock. The majority of typical phones support all of the stated features. So, do not be concerned if you do not grasp all of the technical jargon. Just search the model of your mobile phone online and compare to find out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blur-background-before-google-meet-video-call.jpg"                      alt="Blur background before Google Meet video call"                ></p><p>After entering the password or starting the meeting, you can spot an option to blur on the bottom of the self-view screen.

Q) What is the best free video conferencing software?"></a>1. Q) What is the best free video conferencing software?</h3><p>A) That depends on your needs. For the most comprehensive plan, <strong>Cisco</strong> covers every aspect of the business through interchangeable features. For more extensive group chats, try <strong>Zoom</strong>, but do keep in mind the 40 minute limit on your call times. If your team speak different languages, then use <strong>Skype</strong> – who have a <a class="link"   href="https://www.csmonitor.com/Technology/2016/1212/Skype-s-real-time-language-translator-Can-it-really-connect-the-world" >real-time language-translation tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that shaves hours off your day. Lastly, <strong>UberConference</strong> is arguably the best free video conferencing software for companies who work with lots of different contractors or freelancers on a day-to-day basis. This is because you don’t need to download anything and can just jump straight in.</p><h3 id="2-Q-Is-Zoom-the-same-as-Skype"><a href="#2-Q-Is-Zoom-the-same-as-Skype" class="headerlink" title="2. Q) Is Zoom the same as Skype?"></a>2. Q) Is Zoom the same as Skype?</h3><p>A) Not quite, Skype has more of an International calling focus, while Zoom is more business meeting and conference intuitive. Zoom takes webinars and video teaching and learning as more of a priority than Skype does. Skype, on the other hand, allows free international calling by assigning local caller ID to your number.</p><h3 id="3-Q-What-is-the-best-Video-Conferencing-Software-for-Small-Businesses"><a href="#3-Q-What-is-the-best-Video-Conferencing-Software-for-Small-Businesses" class="headerlink" title="3. Q) What is the best Video Conferencing Software for Small Businesses"></a>3. Q) What is the best Video Conferencing Software for Small Businesses</h3><p>A) UberConference should match your needs. It gives you the ability to communicate with up to 50 workers, more than enough for any small business. It also means you aren’t continually inviting contractors to download software. That being said, the type you use, or that best suits your firm, depends entirely on what you need it for and how you use it.</p><h2 id="To-Conclude"><a href="#To-Conclude" class="headerlink" title="To Conclude"></a>To Conclude</h2><p>There is a perfect video conferencing software app or program for everyone, but which suits your company best will depend on what your business is. We hope we have provided you with enough information that you can make a reasonable choice. What matters most is that you get online and work from home. Being indoors shouldn’t have to be the end of the world.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/quick-start-to-mastering-io-screen-recording-for-2024/"><u>Quick Start to Mastering IO Screen Recording for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-ios-psp-games-and-emulators-revealed/"><u>2024 Approved  Top iOS PSP Games & Emulators Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-miui-screen-recorder-review/"><u>[Updated] MIUI Screen Recorder Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-get-to-know-vrecorder-the-perfect-installation-process-for-2024/"><u>[New] Get to Know VRecorder  The Perfect Installation Process for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-top-6-simple-minecraft-house-ideas/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Top 6 Simple Minecraft House Ideas</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-the-beginners-guide-to-free-screen-capture-software-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Beginner's Guide to Free Screen Capture Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-elite-web-based-recording-tools/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Elite Web-Based Recording Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/elevate-conference-engagement-with-zoom-for-2024/"><u>Elevate Conference Engagement with Zoom for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-threads-through-time-master-looms-screen-capture/"><u>[New] In 2024, Threads Through Time  Master Loom's Screen Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-determining-top-screen-recorder-obs-studio-vs-bandicam/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Determining Top Screen Recorder  OBS Studio Vs.

In addition, developers are continually innovating their programs to make your document processing easier. For example, you can now use google translate voice to text when you are typing a document for a diverse audience.</p><p>Below is a full guide on how to translate speech to text the right way with Google Translate. In addition, you will discover alternatives to google speech translate, including their summary and how they compare to one another.</p><h2 id="Part1-How-to-translate-speech-to-text-with-Google-Translate"><a href="#Part1-How-to-translate-speech-to-text-with-Google-Translate" class="headerlink" title="Part1: How to translate speech to text with Google Translate?"></a>Part1: How to translate speech to text with Google Translate?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/google-speech-translate-1.jpg"                      alt="translate speech"                ></p><p>Google Translate is one of the easiest voice typing apps to use. However, before you go through the steps on how to use Google speech translate, here are a few points you need to consider:</p><ul><li>You need to have an external microphone to use google speech translate. Laptop and notebook owners can rely on their in-built microphone, and desktop users will need an external one. In addition, using a headset has better results than an external microphone.</li><li>Ensure you allow google translate voice to text to access your device’s microphone. You will find your microphone settings in the <strong>Control Panel</strong> for Windows and <strong>Preferences</strong> if you are a Mac user.</li><li>Unfortunately, you cannot upload audio files to Google speech translate. In addition, there is no information if subsequent updates of the app will include the feature.</li><li>Regarding Google speech to text pricing, the app is free to download and use. Although the service is available from the web browser, having an active Google account enables you to access its full features.</li><li>Although Google translate voice to text can detect your language, it does suffer accuracy issues occasionally. Therefore, confirm that you select the correct language before using the translation service.</li></ul><p>The above points apply to all versions of Google speech translate, whether on your smartphone, tablet, or computer. Now that you are aware of the app’s key user points, here is how you can translate speech to text with Google Translate:</p><p>1. Launch the app from your device’s home screen or the installation directory for computer users.</p><p>2. Select the languages you want to translate from the main screen using the arrow buttons on the bottom right corner of each box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/google-speech-translate-2.jpg"                      alt="arrow buttons"                ></p><p>For example, if you want to translate English to French, English will appear in the first box and French in the other. Kindly note that the app does not detect microphone input automatically. The feature is only available for typed text.</p><p>3. Proceed to the bottom of the page and click the Microphone button to begin translating your speech to text input. Ensure you are in a quiet environment for best results.</p><p>4. You can end your recording by clicking the Stop button.</p><p>5. You can listen to your translation by clicking the Listen button from the right box of Google speech translate. In addition, you can switch between playback speeds by pressing the Listen button repeatedly.</p><h2 id="Part2-How-to-translate-recorded-speeches-with-Google-Translate"><a href="#Part2-How-to-translate-recorded-speeches-with-Google-Translate" class="headerlink" title="Part2: How to translate recorded speeches with Google Translate?"></a>Part2: How to translate recorded speeches with Google Translate?</h2><p>Unfortunately, Google Translate does not support the translation of audio file uploads, such as recorded speeches and music files. The service only supports translation of the following file types;</p><ul><li>Docx</li><li>Pdf</li><li>Pptx</li><li>Xlsx</li></ul><p>It also allows you to translate websites in your browser automatically. Here is how to translate websites with Google Translate:</p><ol><li>Click on the Websites tab from the app’s home page.</li><li>Select the original language as Detect Language because the app refers to its over 100-language library to determine the source language. Inputting the wrong source language will result in an incorrect translation.</li><li>Type the URL you need to translate in the Website textbox and click Go to view the website in your preferred language.</li></ol><p>So, how can you translate recorded audio using Google Translate? Follow the below steps:</p><h3 id="Use-other-transcribe-tools-to-transcript-the-audio"><a href="#Use-other-transcribe-tools-to-transcript-the-audio" class="headerlink" title="Use other transcribe tools to transcript the audio"></a>Use other transcribe tools to transcript the audio</h3><p>As earlier mentioned, you can only use Google Translate with text documents and websites. As such, you need to transcribe the recorded speech using a different transcription app, then upload the transcript to Google Translate. The compatible file formats are .docx, .pdf, .pptx, and .xlsx.</p><p>Some of the transcribing apps you can use include, Trint, Rev, and Happy Scribe. In addition, check if the apps require you to purchase a subscription before using them. Although some apps offer free trials, your access may have feature limitations. For example, most apps limit transcription of recorded audio files to between five and sixty minutes, depending on the developer.</p><h3 id="Paste-to-Google-translate"><a href="#Paste-to-Google-translate" class="headerlink" title="Paste to Google translate"></a>Paste to Google translate</h3><p>Once you finish transcribing the speech recording from the third-party app, ensure you save it in the file formats indicated above.

Typically, the app lists English, Spanish, and Arabic as the default language options. However, you will find additional languages by clicking the down arrow on the right. Google Translate has over 100 languages in its internal library, including Xhosa and Latin. Despite this, you should always check the translation accuracy before submitting your work. This is because the app can sometimes ignore the translation language’s grammar and punctuation rules.</li></ol><h3 id="What’s-the-Best-Alternative-to-Google-STT-Translation"><a href="#What’s-the-Best-Alternative-to-Google-STT-Translation" class="headerlink" title="What’s the Best Alternative to Google STT Translation?"></a>What’s the Best Alternative to Google STT Translation?</h3><p>Google translate voice to text is among the top voice typing apps in the market.

Frame drop is a common issue if you are using OBS Studio for recording high-end games or live streaming with high output resolution. You can easily understand about OBS drop frames while streaming when your viewers complain about lagging and stuttering.</p><p>In fact, you can even check OBS stream status to find out about OBS Studio drop frames. Dropping frames literally ruins the recording and hence, it needs to be fixed before further operation. You need to understand the reasons behind OBS losing frames and take actions accordingly to fix the issue. In this article, we will explain the reasons and provide all the possible solutions to prevent OBS dropping frames recording and streaming.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-OBS-Drops-Frames"><a href="#Part-1-Why-OBS-Drops-Frames" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why OBS Drops Frames?"></a><strong>Part 1. Why OBS Drops Frames?</strong></h2><p>OBS can drop the frame rate due to various reasons. When too many frames are dropped, the streaming server is disconnected. Dropped frames are one of the main causes which can affect streaming playback. Besides, a drop in frames leads to bad recording of screen and gameplay. Here are some of the reasons why OBS drops frames while recording or streaming.</p><ul><li>Your computer has an unstable internet connection.</li><li>Your computer has low-end hardware configuration.</li><li>Your video output resolution is very high.</li><li>Your video bitrate is very high.</li><li>Your internet upload speed is rather low.</li><li>antivirus or firewall is messing with OBS Studio.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Fix-OBS-Dropping-Frame"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Fix-OBS-Dropping-Frame" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How To Fix OBS Dropping Frame?"></a><strong>Part 2. How To Fix OBS Dropping Frame?</strong></h2><h2 id="Way-1-Update-OBS-Run-as-an-Administrator"><a href="#Way-1-Update-OBS-Run-as-an-Administrator" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Update OBS &amp; Run as an Administrator"></a>Way 1. Update OBS &amp; Run as an Administrator</h2><p>It is important to know that you are using the latest version of OBS. This helps to prevent encoding overload as well as problems due to stuttering. Make sure that you run OBS as an administrator. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Download and install the latest version of OBS Studio.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Start menu and search for OBS Studio.</p><p>Step 3: Right-click on the OBS icon and select Run As Administrator option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-run-as-an-administrator.jpg"                      alt="obs run as an administrator"                ></p><h2 id="Way-2-Reduce-The-Output-Resolution"><a href="#Way-2-Reduce-The-Output-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Reduce The Output Resolution"></a>Way 2. Reduce The Output Resolution</h2><p>When you reduce the resolution, the video quality gets lowered. But for smooth streaming and recording, you have no other option. When you reduce resolution, you require less CPU usage and less internet bandwidth. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Select Video tab. You will see Base and Output resolution.</p><p>Step 3: You have to reduce Output Resolution from the current or default setting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-reduce-the-output-resolution.jpg"                      alt="obs reduce the output resolution"                ></p><p>Step 4: Click Apply for saving the changes followed by Ok button.</p><h2 id="Way-3-Reduce-The-Video-Bitrate"><a href="#Way-3-Reduce-The-Video-Bitrate" class="headerlink" title="Way 3. Reduce The Video Bitrate"></a>Way 3. Reduce The Video Bitrate</h2><p>OBS generally does not maintain a specified bitrate. It keeps on changing the bitrate as per the available condition like CPU usage level and bandwidth and speed of internet connection. When there are constant changes in the bitrate, there is a likelihood of stuttering effect. Even though it has come up with Dynamic bitrate which will automatically reduce the bitrate, but it increases the bitrate when there is no congestion. You can reduce the bitrate by going through these steps.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS Studio and click on Settings button.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Output tab and look for Video Bitrate option.</p><p>Step 3: Lower the video bitrate from the default or current value.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Apply and OK button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-reduce-the-video-birate.jpg"                      alt="obs reduce the video birate"                ></p><h2 id="Way-4-Change-OBS-Process-Priority"><a href="#Way-4-Change-OBS-Process-Priority" class="headerlink" title="Way 4. Change OBS Process Priority"></a>Way 4. Change OBS Process Priority</h2><p>By changing the OBS process priority from Normal to Above Normal, there could be more processing power availability for OBS Studio. It helps in solving the problem of frame drop by driving performance from the system for better encoding and rendering. Here are the steps for changing OBS process priority.</p><p>Step 1: Launch OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 3: Go to Advanced tab and look for Process Priority.</p><p>Step 4: You will have to change it to ‘Above Normal’ from ‘Normal’.</p><p>Step 5: Click Apply followed by Ok button.</p><h2 id="Way-5-Update-Network-Driver"><a href="#Way-5-Update-Network-Driver" class="headerlink" title="Way 5. Update Network Driver"></a>Way 5. Update Network Driver</h2><p>Dropped frame rates can happen due to the outdated network adapter driver. For this, it is important to look for the latest version of the driver. With up-to-date drivers, there will be a smooth connection when you are streaming or playing online games. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: From Start menu, search for Device Manager and open it.</p><p>Step 2: Find Network Adapters and click on it to expand.</p><p>Step 3: Find your LAN card and right-click on it.</p><p>Step 4: From the menu, select Update Driver option.</p><p>Follow the onscreen instruction to complete the process and restart your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/device-manager-update-network-driver-2.jpg"                      alt="device manager update network driver"                ></p><h2 id="Way-6-Turn-Off-Your-Firewall-and-Antivirus"><a href="#Way-6-Turn-Off-Your-Firewall-and-Antivirus" class="headerlink" title="Way 6. Turn Off Your Firewall and Antivirus"></a>Way 6. Turn Off Your Firewall and Antivirus</h2><p>There can be instances where firewalls can block the port for RTMP. It can interfere with the internet connection leading to dropping frames. Similarly, antivirus software messes with any third-party software and prevents regular operations. You have to temporarily turn off real-time protection as well as the antivirus software. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Start menu and search for Firewall.</p><p>Step 2: Open Firewall &amp; Network Protection.</p><p>Step 3: Turn off firewall for domain, private and public network temporarily to fix dropping frame issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/turn-off-your-firewall-and--antivirus.jpg"                      alt="turn off your firewall and antivirus"                ></p><p>Step 4: Go to Virus &amp; Threat Protection.</p><p>Step 5: Under Virus &amp; Threat Protection section. Click on Manage Settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/window-security-manage-settings.jpg"                      alt="window security manage settings"                ></p><p>Step 6: Turn on real-time Protection option as well as other available options as applicable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-security-real-time-protection.jpg"                      alt="windows security real time protection"                ></p><h2 id="Way-7-Use-OBS-Alternative-Tool"><a href="#Way-7-Use-OBS-Alternative-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Way 7. Use OBS Alternative Tool"></a>Way 7. Use OBS Alternative Tool</h2><p>If the problem is not solved even after trying out all the above-mentioned ways to fix OBS dropping frames recording, you need to switch to a better alternative for recording high-quality videos without drop frame issue.
