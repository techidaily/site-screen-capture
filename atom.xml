Key Features of Active Presenter</h2><p>Active Presenter is a popular tutorial and software simulation screen recorder that is known for its key features. It offers many of the same capabilities as a standard screen recorder, allowing users to record any type of video.</p><p>Recording – Recording allows you to capture video from your screen and webcam at the same time or independently, and audio from your system or an external microphone. Voice-overs and audio narration can also be added.</p><p>Editing – Active Presenter’s video and audio editor allows basic editing, such as cutting, copying, pasting and deleting. Complex modifications can also be made to audio and video clips - users can insert clips, speed up or slow down videos, blur items or apply green screen effects to them.</p><p>Software Simulation – Apart from recording regular video, you can record software simulation. In software simulation, you get a series of slides instead of a video. These slides can be regular slides or video slides. In video slides, your scrolling actions and drag-and-drop actions are recorded with full-motion recording.

The design is responsive and hence, it can run on any web browser on any device.</p><p>Versatile Export Options – Various export options are available, allowing you to export your video in multiple file formats including MP4, AVI, WMV, and MKV. You can also customize the frame rate, video quality, keyframe parameters, and other settings to decrease the output file size.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-Active-Presenter"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-Active-Presenter" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Because of this, it becomes imperative to ensure that anything that the meeting attendees see looks decent and professional. One of the things that most people get conscious about during a video call is the background.</p><p>Many times, the walls of the rooms the organizer and&#x2F;or the invitees are using during the session might not be well-maintained. This is the main reason why everyone using the app must learn <strong>how to blur the background in Teams</strong>.</p><p>With that said, the following sections explain <strong>how to blur the background in Microsoft Teams</strong> on a computer, cellphone, and tablet.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Blur Background on Teams on a Windows Laptop Before or During a Video Call</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Blur Background on Teams on a MacBook Pro Before or During a Video Call</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Blur Background in Teams Mobile App Before or During a Video Call</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: FAQs about Blur Teams Meeting Background</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: How to Blur Video Background on Teams Recorded Video?</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Blur-Background-on-Teams-on-a-Windows-Laptop-Before-or-During-a-Video-Call"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Blur-Background-on-Teams-on-a-Windows-Laptop-Before-or-During-a-Video-Call" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Blur Background on Teams on a Windows Laptop Before or During a Video Call?"></a>Part 1: How to Blur Background on Teams on a Windows Laptop Before or During a Video Call?</h2><p>Microsoft Teams allows you to blur the background of the webcam footage before you start or join a video call, during an ongoing session. The methods of getting this done on the laptop computers are explained below in detail.</p><p>The following sections explain <strong>how to blur the background on Teams</strong> both before and during a video call while working on a Windows laptop. The step-by-step instructions are given below:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Blur-Background-on-Teams-Before-Video-Call"><a href="#Method-1-Blur-Background-on-Teams-Before-Video-Call" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Blur Background on Teams Before Video Call"></a>Method 1: Blur Background on Teams Before Video Call</h3><p>If you have a meeting scheduled at a particular time but don’t know what to do with that homely background that wouldn’t go with the professional ambiance, luckily Microsoft Teams lets you blur it quite conveniently. The process is described as follows:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Initiate a New Meeting Session</strong></p><p>Launch Microsoft Teams, and make sure that the <strong>Chat</strong> icon is selected in the left pane. From the top of the <strong>Chat</strong> pane, click the <strong>New Meeting</strong> (<strong>Camcorder</strong>) icon, and click <strong>Start meeting</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-video-call-teams.jpg"                      alt="Start Microsoft Teams video call on Windows laptop"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Check the Devices</strong></p><p>On the <strong>Meeting with</strong> box, make sure that the <strong>Video</strong> and <strong>Audio</strong> switches present under the preview screen are enabled. Turn them on if they’re disabled. Next, click the <strong>Background effects</strong> (<strong>Person</strong>) icon from under the preview screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/microsoft-teams-blur-background-option.jpg"                      alt="  Microsoft Teams background blur"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Blur the Background before video call starts</strong></p><p>From the <strong>Background settings</strong> pane that appears next, and click to select the <strong>Blur</strong> tile. After this, you can safely click the <strong>Join now</strong> button to start a Teams video meeting with the blurred background.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blur-video-background-microsoft-teams.jpg"                      alt="  Microsoft Teams background blur"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> While using other operating systems&#x2F;laptops like Linux, Chromebook, etc., the process of blurring the background before a video call is identical. This means all you need to do is, initiate a new video meeting, click the <strong>Background effects</strong> (<strong>Person</strong>) icon from under the preview screen, and select the <strong>Blur</strong> tile before clicking the <strong>Join now</strong> button.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Blur-Background-on-Teams-During-Video-Call"><a href="#Method-2-Blur-Background-on-Teams-During-Video-Call" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Blur Background on Teams During Video Call"></a>Method 2: Blur Background on Teams During Video Call</h3><p>If you started or joined a Teams meeting without blurring the background, and want to do so during an ongoing call, you can follow the instructions given below to learn <strong>how to blur background in Teams</strong> while in a virtual conference session:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Open the Background settings Pane</strong></p><p>During an ongoing video call, click <strong>More actions</strong> from the upper-right area of the meeting window, and click <strong>Apply background effects</strong> from the menu that comes down.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apply-background-effects-microsoft-teams.jpg"                      alt="  blur background during Microsoft Teams"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Blur Background during the video call</strong></p><p>When the <strong>Background settings</strong> pane opens on the right of the window, click to select the <strong>Blur</strong> tile.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Save the Changes</strong></p><p>From the bottom of the <strong>Background settings</strong> pane, click <strong>Apply</strong> to blur the background.

If you’re using the Android phone or tablet, you may not blur the background on Teams video call. You can learn <strong>how to blur the background in Microsoft Teams</strong> while using an iOS device (iPhone X is used here for illustration) by following the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Start a New Meeting</strong></p><p>Launch Microsoft Teams on your iPhone or iPad, ensure that the <strong>Chat</strong> icon is selected from the bottom of the interface, tap the <strong>Instant meeting</strong> (<strong>Camcorder</strong>) icon from the top-right corner of the screen, and tap <strong>Start meeting</strong> from the bottom of the box that appears next.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-video-call-teams-iphone.jpg"                      alt="start Microsoft Teams  call on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Get to the Background Effects Screen</strong></p><p>On the next screen, tap to enable both <strong>Video</strong> and <strong>Audio</strong> functions from the bottom, tap the <strong>More actions</strong> icon, and then tap <strong>Background effects</strong> from the box that comes up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/microsoft-teams-iphone-background-effects.jpg"                      alt=" blur Microsoft Teams  background on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Blur the Background</strong></p><p>On the <strong>Select background</strong> screen, tap <strong>Blur</strong> from the options available in the box at the bottom, and tap <strong>Done</strong> from the top-right corner to apply the changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blur-teams-video-call-background-iphone.jpg"                      alt=" blur Microsoft Teams  background on iPhone"                ></p><h2 id="FAQs-about-Blur-Teams-Meeting-Background"><a href="#FAQs-about-Blur-Teams-Meeting-Background" class="headerlink" title="FAQs about Blur Teams Meeting Background"></a>FAQs about Blur Teams Meeting Background</h2><p><strong>Q1) Why can’t I blur my background in Microsoft Teams?</strong></p><p><strong>A1)</strong> If you’re unable to see the ‘Blur’ tile or the ‘Background settings’ option altogether, probably your PC doesn’t have Advanced Vector Extension 2 (AVX2) graphics. While Microsoft is still working to make the ‘Blur’ option enable for all the devices, no official statement from the organization has been released to date.</p><p>On the other hand, if your computer has AVX2 and you still cannot see the option, you can try a couple of things, and see if any of those works for you. For instance, you can:</p><ul><li>Sign out of Teams and then sign back in</li><li>Check for and update the webcam driver</li><li>Check for and install the most updated version of Microsoft Teams</li><li>Restart your computer</li></ul><p><strong>Q2) Can I blur the background in the Teams Business version?</strong></p><p><strong>A2)</strong> Yes, you can. Microsoft Teams (Free), Microsoft 365 Business Basic, and Microsoft 365 Business Standard versions allow you to blur the background with ease.

Using OBS game capture, you may record screen games for YouTube videos or share snippets of gameplay with your friends for free. With this article, we’ll cover how to record in OBS and how much storage space you’ll need for your recordings. With OBS, it’s easy to keep track of high scores, great in-game performances, and even tips on how to play like a pro quickly and effectively. Since gamers may use several third-party screen-recording techniques when recording their games, learning how to record gameplay using OBS is an ideal solution. An open-source tool called OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) will be utilized in this lesson.</p><p>It is widely utilized by both large and small broadcasters throughout the world because of its reliability as a streaming solution. Despite this, it’s an effective tool for capturing images. OBS Studio enables you to record video directly to your device instead of broadcasting your screen. The days of framed screenshots and complex settings are over. Video game streamers and teachers with a lot of video presentations are likely to be acquainted with the OBS Studio. However, due to the complex user interface, it’s a little tough for beginners to utilize. The good news is that there are a variety of OBS options to pick from. When it comes to performance, it’s on par with other, more costly options. For the most part, the program allows for live streaming to several sites, such as Facebook Live and Hitbox.</p><h2 id="1-Download-and-Install-OBS-on-Mac"><a href="#1-Download-and-Install-OBS-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="1. Download and Install OBS on Mac"></a>1. Download and Install OBS on Mac</h2><p>OBS is an open-source screen recorder and live streamer that is free to use. It’s now available on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. It’s a popular choice among more seasoned customers because of the large variety of options available in the product.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Go to the OBS Website</strong></p><p>Go to the OBS download page using your choice browser and save the installation file to your computer’s hard drive.<br>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://obsproject.com/download" >OBS Website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Step 2: Get the Most Recent Version of the Software</strong></p><p>You may get the most recent version of OBS for Mac by clicking the button on the OBS website.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Download and Install the Software for Mac</strong></p><p>Open the package after downloading it. Drag the OBS icon to the Applications folder when the installer has been opened.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-and-install.jpg"                      alt="download video from funimate"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Get Started!</strong></p><p>Open OBS for the first time by going to the Applications folder and double-clicking on it. Selected ‘Continue’ will bring up a Welcome Screen for the Installer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-started.jpg"                      alt="get-started"                ></p><h2 id="2-Best-OBS-Settings-for-Mac"><a href="#2-Best-OBS-Settings-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="2. Best OBS Settings for Mac"></a>2. Best OBS Settings for Mac</h2><p>OBS Studio is a complex software that comes with pre-installed screencasting capabilities. Free software often lacks the breadth of features required for flawless broadcasting, but not with OSB Studio. Even though the program is free, it features all of the crucial components that characterize online broadcasting. Many additional parts and modules will be given by the software now and then. That suggests it’s really necessary to dabble and refresh with it. Else, you can experience a few hassles in using OBS correctly.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Launch and Create Output Recorder Setup</strong></p><p>Add on the Plus symbol and create the project. If you want to activate audio monitoring in OBS Studio: Right-click in the Output box, Open the Output mode or you can also go for Advanced Audio Properties:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/output-recorder-setup.jpg"                      alt="output recorder setup"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Customize Record Only Feature</strong></p><p>In OBS for Mac, this setting will deliver the sound of the source to the Desktop as it were. Work area sound should be enabled for the sound to be captured. As soon as you activate this option, navigate towards the recording interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-record.jpg"                      alt="customize record"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Set the Screen and Output Mode</strong></p><p>In OBS Studio for Mac, this setting will broadcast the sound of the source to the stream and Desktop sound separately. This takes into mind individual sound control. To do so, go to the bottom right corner of your screen and pick “settings.” Then, under “recording path,” select the “output” option to specify the spot on your computer where you desire to keep the recordings. Right after that, press the Record button to start recording your Game Audio in parallel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/output-mode.jpg"                      alt="output mode"                ></p><h2 id="3-How-to-Record-Screen-with-OBS-on-Mac"><a href="#3-How-to-Record-Screen-with-OBS-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="3. How to Record Screen with OBS on Mac"></a>3. How to Record Screen with OBS on Mac</h2><p>OBS Studio is open-source, free software that is worth a try for all users. This strategy may be used to solve the problem if you have two graphics cards, one of which is NVIDIA. The OBS black screen is most likely caused by OBS and the game you desire to record running on different graphics cards in this situation. The image of the game can’t be acquired as they’re on separate adapters, and it’s not available on the device OBS is utilizing.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Install and Launch OBS</strong></p><p>To purchase OBS Studio, go to the OBS Project’s official website and join up for their download portal. OBS is available for download and installation. After that, determine whether you want to use Windows, macOS, or Linux. Click the “Windows” download option on the left to acquire OBS for Windows. After clicking it, the download for OBS Studio will begin and the user will be able to locate it on their computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-and-launch.jpg"                      alt="install and launch"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Add Scenes for Recording</strong></p><p>OBS Studio will be available on their PC when the installation is complete, and players may use it to record their Valorous games. The software, on the other hand, does not come pre-configured for recording and must be set up manually. Scenes should be added. Open OBS and go to the bottom left of the screen to the “+” icon below “scenes.” Add a “recording” scenario to the mix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-scenes.jpg"                      alt="add scenes"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Customize the Recording</strong></p><p>Users should go to the Output tab and set the Video Bitrate to 6000 Kbps, Encoder to Hardware, and Audio Bitrate to 256 after entering the settings. Users may also adjust the location of their recording by choosing the save path location in the same settings tab., in the “recording” scene, click the “+” sign below “sources” on the bottom left of the screen, and add a “display capture.” If you have more than one monitor, specify which one you wish to record.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/output-tab.jpg"                      alt="output tab"                ></p><p>You may add a “Video Capture Device” to capture your webcam and an “Audio Input Capture” to gather the sounds from your microphone if you wish to. The next step is for users to go to the Audio tab and deactivate Desktop Audio. Users may add an audio input device, such as a microphone, by setting the Mic&#x2F;Auxiliary device under the same tab.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Setup the Recording</strong></p><p>Now, in the bottom left corner of the screen, click the “Scene” button, and then tap the Add icon next to the scene tab under the sources tab. A drop-down menu will display after selecting the add button, enabling you to add Game Capture and Audio Output Capture. Two more tabs will appear under the sources tab, which must be set. Choose a shooting location as well as a video type. Finally, pick “recording format” and “mp4” (or any other file type) from the drop-down menu. In the “Best Parameters for OBS Recordings,” we’ll go over various additional variables that need to be modified to ensure high-quality outputs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-the-recording.jpg"                      alt="setup the recording"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5: Start&#x2F;Stop Recording</strong></p><p>Users may start recording their gameplay by hitting the “Start Recording” button on the bottom-right of OBS Studio when everything is set up. To stop recording, simply press the Stop Recording button, and the video will be saved at the previously set location. Now is the moment to hit the “start recording” button.</p><h2 id="4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-on-Mac"><a href="#4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="4.

Boasting a number of quirky features, such as multi-user functionality and a virus-free operating system based on Linux, Chromebooks even showcase the ability to allow users to capture screenshots in a number of different manners with ease. Within this article we’ve composed a 6-section guide on how to take a screenshot on a Chromebook, as well as how to edit them, at the touch of a button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h2 id="1-Taking-Screenshots-on-a-Chromebook-with-a-Keyboard"><a href="#1-Taking-Screenshots-on-a-Chromebook-with-a-Keyboard" class="headerlink" title="1. Taking Screenshots on a Chromebook with a Keyboard"></a>1. Taking Screenshots on a Chromebook with a Keyboard</h2><p>Similar to the typical CTRL + PrtScn or PrtScn shortcut used on most Window’s PCs, or the Command + Control + Shift + 3 shortcut used on Mac devices, taking screenshots with the use of a keyboard on a Chromebook is equally as straight forward. To capture a screenshot of the entire screen, the process requires the use of the <strong>Windows Switcher Key</strong> (look for 3 layered rectangles that resemble open tabs&#x2F;windows) – this is generally located above the number 6 and 7 keys and close to the screen-brightness toggles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-keyboard-screenshot.jpg"                      alt=" Chromebook Screenshot"                ></p><p>The command “**Ctrl + *Windows Switcher Key*<strong>” will capture a screenshot of your current page, and the command “</strong>Ctrl + Shift + *Windows Switcher Key***” will allow users to capture a partial screenshot with the help from a handy drag-selector tool.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: If your keyboard doesn’t seem to have the Screen Switcher key, <strong>try using F5 instead</strong>. To ensure your screenshot is copied into a specific document, select “<strong>Copy to Clipboard</strong>”. From here, you’ll be able to paste directly into a document.</p><h2 id="2-Taking-a-Screenshot-on-a-Chromebook-with-the-Use-of-Side-Buttons"><a href="#2-Taking-a-Screenshot-on-a-Chromebook-with-the-Use-of-Side-Buttons" class="headerlink" title="2. Taking a Screenshot on a Chromebook with the Use of Side Buttons"></a>2. Taking a Screenshot on a Chromebook with the Use of Side Buttons</h2><p>Using your Chromebook in tablet mode? If so, then there’s also a handy way to make use of the screenshot feature whilst on the go. Similar to the function offered on most Smart Phone Devices, simply press both the <strong>Power and Volume Down Side Button</strong> to capture a screenshot.

This is somewhat similar to what people did back in the Yahoo! Messenger era. However, unlike Yahoo! Messenger, Zoom doesn’t have open rooms where users could find new friends. Instead, it allows to chat only with those who are connected to each other through a conference call.</p><p>When talking about the chat configurations, all the contextual options can be accessed by clicking the <strong>Settings</strong> (<strong>Gear</strong>) icon from the top-right corner of the Zoom window, and selecting the <strong>Chat</strong> category from the left bar of the <strong>Settings</strong> window that opens up next.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-setting.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Settings icon"                ></p><p>Once there, following are the options that you can configure to secure your <strong>Zoom chat</strong> experience:</p><ul><li><strong>Active Status</strong></li></ul><p>Checked by default, the <strong>Change my status to “Away” when I am inactive for</strong> ‘n’ <strong>minutes</strong> lets you automatically change your active status to <strong>Away</strong> when Zoom doesn’t detect any input from you for a certain amount of time.

Can Zoom host see private chats?"></a><strong>Q) Is Zoom chat secure, safe, and encrypted? Can Zoom host see private chats?</strong></h4><p><strong>A) Yes and No.</strong></p><p>To answer the first question, Zoom chats are encrypted. However, the encryption is disabled by default and must be enabled by turning on the <strong>Require Encryption for 3rd Party Endpoints (H323&#x2F;SIP)</strong> switch from the <strong>In Meeting (Basic)</strong> section.</p><p>Tips</p><p>As a video call host, if you don’t want the participant to save the chat content, you should enable <strong>Prevent participants from saving chat</strong> and save the changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-prevent-participants-from-saving-chat.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat  Saving Settings"                ></p><p>Furthermore, if you have a paid subscription of Zoom, you can use advanced encryption method that is available on the <strong>IM Management</strong> page on your account’s web portal. About the second question, the host cannot see the private messages that the participants send to each other during a meeting session.</p><h4 id="Q-Can-people-see-my-chat-when-I-am-screen-sharing"><a href="#Q-Can-people-see-my-chat-when-I-am-screen-sharing" class="headerlink" title="Q) Can people see my chat when I am screen sharing?"></a><strong>Q) Can people see my chat when I am screen sharing?</strong></h4><p>A) No.</p><p>As long as you are chatting using <strong>Zoom chat</strong>, other participants cannot see your conversation. However, if there is something else on your screen such as your Facebook profile&#x2F;chat, your email account, or your bank account’s page, all those windows can be viewed by the participants you are sharing your screen with.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong>Zoom chat</strong> is an easy way to converse with the participants in case there are some typical words that need to be spelled or some files to be shared. These chats are not only encrypted, they can also be controlled by the host so that the participants can send messages only to the host, to each other, or to no one at all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-best-alternatives-to-microsofts-game-bar-recording-features/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Best Alternatives to Microsoft's Game Bar Recording Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/pros-picks-best-10-terraria-mods-for-2024/"><u>Pro's Picks  Best 10 Terraria Mods for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-splitcam-vs-competitors-top-tier-video-recording-for-2024/"><u>[New] SplitCam Vs.
