It packs powerful features that make screen recording fun, engaging, and convenient. But in this guidepost, we’ll dwell on the little-known <strong>OBS countdown timer</strong>.</p><p>So, what is the OBS Studio countdown timer, and why do you need to make one? This article discusses that and how to add a countdown timer overlay to your local videos using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Let’s dig in!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-OBS-Countdown-Timers"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-OBS-Countdown-Timers" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is OBS Countdown Timers?"></a>Part 1: What Is OBS Countdown Timers?</h2><p>You probably don’t need a further introduction to a countdown timer if you’re often watching action movies or marking calendars. But clear doubts, a countdown timer is basically the remaining time in years, weeks, days, hours, minutes, or seconds before a start of an event. A good example is those James Bond movies where a bomb has, let’s say, 60 seconds before exploding.</p><p>With that said, you can use the <strong>OBS timer countdown</strong> in multiple ways. For example, you can use it to pump up excitement before a much anticipated live streaming session starts. Remember that OBS Studio supports live streaming to popular platforms like YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-1.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer"                ></p><p>So, the timer will tell viewers the duration they’ll have to wait before the next live session. You can even add an action text after the timer ends. A countdown timer can also help you ensure that the viewer sticks around until the end of an event or video.</p><p>Picture this; you can be a fitness trainer on YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram, etc. In that case, you’ll need to perform each set of exercises for a specific duration, then rest for like 30 or 60 seconds.</p><p>So, add a timer to the video to guide the trainees throughout the session. This helps make the session more engaging and fun. Whichever the reasons you have to add an <strong>OBS count down timer</strong>, the objective is simple; communicate to the viewers the time left before an event starts or ends.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Add-a-Countdown-Timer-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Add-a-Countdown-Timer-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Add a Countdown Timer in OBS"></a>Part 2: How To Add a Countdown Timer in OBS</h2><p>Up to this point, you might think that adding an OBS countdown clock is such a complicated task. After all, OBS isn’t the most beginner-friendly screen recorder to use. But don’t fret because adding a countdown timer is one of the most straightforward things to do in OBS Studio. Let’s do that!</p><p>Step1 Fire up OBS Studio and select a recording scene on which you want to apply the countdown timer. Once the scene is ready, tap the Plus button on the Sources section, then select the Text Source. Now give the source a name. For instance, you can name it Timer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-2.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer add a text source"                ></p><p>Step2 Now you’ll see a pop-up window to customize how the timer will look. For example, click the Select font button to customize the font settings for the countdown timer. You can also customize things like opacity, gradient, background color, alignment, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-3.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer customize timer details"                ></p><p>Step3 Next, click the Tools tab and then tap Scripts. Then, select the countdown.lua file and customize the countdown descriptions on the pop-up window. You can change the countdown duration and the final text after the countdown. Don’t also forget to select Timer as the Text Source. The OBS countdown timer will immediately start counting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-4.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer add the timer file"                ></p><h2 id="Pro-Tip-How-To-Utilize-an-Overlay-To-Level-Up-Your-Countdown-Timer"><a href="#Pro-Tip-How-To-Utilize-an-Overlay-To-Level-Up-Your-Countdown-Timer" class="headerlink" title="Pro Tip: How To Utilize an Overlay To Level Up Your Countdown Timer"></a>Pro Tip: How To Utilize an Overlay To Level Up Your Countdown Timer</h2><p>You’ll definitely need precise timing to get the most out of the <strong>timer countdown on OBS</strong>. Also, sometimes you can record a video on your smartphone or camera and customize it with a countdown timer. If that’s the case, consider using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>It’s a professional-grade video editor for macOS and Windows systems that allows you to add countdown timer overlays to any video. Unlike OBS, this method will enable you to add timer overlays to specific scenes on the footage, including the intro part. Even best is that the countdown timers come in multiple styles, and you can customize the timer with appropriate background audio.</p><p><strong>Steps to create a countdown timer with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h5 id="Step1-Start-a-new-video-project"><a href="#Step1-Start-a-new-video-project" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Start a new video project"></a>Step1 Start a new video project</h5><p>Install and run Filmora on your PC, and start a New Project.

How to disable crossplay? How about cross-progression? Further, which platform is the best to play on? What’s the difference between Steam and Origin?</p><p>In this article, all of the questions above will be answered. No doubt, we have seen a massive increase in the popularity of Apex Legends. Millions of players are grouping in EA’s battle royal game, and it is quite clear why they like it so much. It is a free-to-play game with some quality graphics and gameplay. This game’s core is based around looting and shooting, and it offers a few interesting twists in the battle royal format.</p><hr><h4 id="In-this-article-these-questions-will-be-answered"><a href="#In-this-article-these-questions-will-be-answered" class="headerlink" title="In this article, these questions will be answered"></a>In this article, these questions will be answered</h4><hr><p>Apex Legends Gameplay Basics:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Apex-gameplay.jpg"                                     ></p><p>In this battle royal game, you are a part of a 3-person squad. There are 14 playable characters to choose from, and they are called legends in the game. If you compare all legends, you will find that they are equal in strength, speed, and firepower. It’s their special abilities that make them different from each other. Every character has a unique ability that can help you in-game to leverage other players. So, you can choose a legend that suits your playstyle and is a perfect fit for your squad.</p><p>Teamwork is very critical in this game. When you jump into the battleground, there are two teammates on your side. Make sure to stick with them during the match if you want to win it. By working together, you can protect each other and outmatch the enemies by combining your abilities. You can stay connected with your teammates using the in-game communication system. You can mark different locations, highlight threats, pinpoint the location of gear pieces, and tell your teammates in which direction you are going.</p><p>There is a ring around the battleground that shrinks after fixed short intervals. As the rink shrinks, it forces the players into a smaller space on the map, and as a result, we observe more fights between different teams. If you want to win the game, then you have to be the last team standing. If your teammates are knocked down, then you can revive them and pick them up. If they are completely killed, you can pick up their banner in a fixed amount of time and have them jumped back into the game once again. This feature makes this game different from other battle royal games where if your teammate dies once, then he stays dead the rest of the game.</p><p>One thing that you must keep in mind while playing this game is that killing an opponent is a bit longer than other FPS (First Person Shooting) games. To kill an opponent, you may need to rely on several headshots, your legends’ unique ability, and the support of your teammates.</p><p>Although this game is free of cost, it offers several in-game purchases. You can purchase Apex Coins, which is an in-game currency. <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Apex-ingame-purchase.jpg"                                     ></p><p>You can use it to purchase loot boxes that contain skins and costumes. There are two locked characters in the game also, and you need to purchase them with Apex coins. So, you can get the maximum out of this game by spending some money and giving time to this game.</p><hr><h4 id="Can-Apex-Legends-crossplay-or-not"><a href="#Can-Apex-Legends-crossplay-or-not" class="headerlink" title="Can Apex Legends crossplay or not?"></a><strong>Can Apex Legends crossplay or not?</strong></h4><p>Yes, Apex Legends is a cross-platform game. Initially, it wasn’t a cross-platform game, but Apex became a cross-platform game after an update in autumn 2020. It means that two players playing on two different devices can group in a squad and play the game. Let’s explain it with an example. Suppose you have a pc and your friend has a PS4. Both of you can play together in a squad, even if you both have two different types of devices.</p><h4 id="How-to-turn-off-crossplay"><a href="#How-to-turn-off-crossplay" class="headerlink" title="How to turn off crossplay?"></a><strong>How to turn off crossplay?</strong></h4><p>Firstly, crossplay is enabled by default. Assume now you’re playing apex on PS4&#x2F;switch&#x2F;Xbox using a controller, you might be reluctant to crossplay against a PC player using keyboard and mouse. Because you might think that isn’t fair. So why don’t we turn it off and play only with game console players?</p><p>Step1, to disable it, you need to go to the setting button at the lobby’s right bottom, as shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apex-setting1.png"                      alt="ape-setting1"                ></p><p>Step 2, under the gameplay tab, scroll down, and you can find cross-platform play.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apex-setting2.png"                      alt="apex-setting2"                ></p><h4 id="Does-it-have-cross-progression"><a href="#Does-it-have-cross-progression" class="headerlink" title="Does it have cross-progression?"></a><strong>Does it have cross-progression?</strong></h4><p>Unfortunately, because of technical and legal issues, no. It means that your characters&#x2F;purchased items will not be synced through platforms. Simply put, you will have to start all over again if you change your platform.</p><hr><h4 id="Which-platform-is-the-best-to-play-on"><a href="#Which-platform-is-the-best-to-play-on" class="headerlink" title="Which platform is the best to play on?"></a><strong>Which platform is the best to play on?</strong></h4><p>The best thing about Apex Legends is that it has multiplatform support. You can play it on different platforms like:</p><p><strong>Microsoft Xbox One S and X</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/xbox-one.jpg"                                     >You can play Apex Legends on Xbox One S, but you may need to compromise a little bit and play on a low resolution for better fps. Although the game will run just fine, you may need to make some adjustments to your graphics settings. You can play this game on 720p on Xbox One S, so make sure to sit a little closer to your screen to see everything.</p><p>If you want to get Apex’s best experience on Xbox consoles, you should play it on Xbox One X. If you switch from Xbox one S to Xbox one X, you will see a significant difference in the game performance. On the X version, you can run the game on 1080p. It offers overall better performance in terms of gameplay as compared to other Xbox variants.</p><p><strong>Xbox Series X and S</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/xbox-seriesx.jpg"                                     >Xbox series S and X are the latest generations of Xbox. They rival their competitor PS5 and offer competitive performance when you compare these consoles with a PS5. They do offer better gaming performance and better graphics. But, the question is, Can you play Apex on the latest generations of Xbox? The answer is yes. You will get better performance in terms of graphics and FPS but currently, the game isn’t fully optimized for the latest generations. In the coming days it is expected that the game will be optimized for the latest consoles and you can enjoy the game to the fullest. Currently, you can enjoy 1440p gaming on these consoles and can get up to 120fps.</p><p><strong>Sony PlayStation 4</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Apex-ps4.png"                                     >You can also play Apex Legends on Sony PlayStation 4. Although you can play it on the standard PS4, if you want to get the best gaming experience, then you should play it on PS4 Pro. On PS4, you need to have a PlayStation Plus subscription if you want to play online multiplayer games, but in the case of Apex Legends, you do not need it.</p><p><strong>Sony PlayStation 5</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ps5-poster.png"                      alt="ps5-poster"                ></p><p>Sony PlayStation 5 is a next-generation console, and luckily Apex Legends is already playable on it. PS5 offers improved performance and better graphics as compared to its previous versions. If you were previously playing on PS4 and just switched to PS5, you can also retain all your progress and skins on PS5 also. You can use the same EA account and start enjoying Apex Legends on 1440p screen resolution.</p><p><strong>PC</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PC-apex.png"                                     >If you want to do competitive gaming in Apex Legends, then PC is the most suitable choice for you. It is because when you play using a mouse and keyboard instead of controllers, then your aim and movement are more precise. As it is an FPS category game, you can use a monitor with a high refresh rate to have smooth gameplay and reduce the lag. You must keep in mind that you need a PC with some good specs that can provide you with at least 60fps in the game. It would be best if you aim for a PC that can provide you maximum fps. 120 is the most recommended figure here.</p><p>PC Requirements For Apex Legends:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Components</strong></th><th><strong>Minimum</strong></th><th><strong>Recommended</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 7 (64-Bit)</td><td>Windows 7 (64-Bit)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU</strong></td><td>Intel Core i3-6100 or AMD FX-4350</td><td>Intel Core i5-3570K or AMD equivalent</td></tr><tr><td><strong>RAM</strong></td><td>6GB</td><td>8GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GT 640 AMD Radeon HD 7730</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 AMD Radeon R9 290</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU RAM</strong></td><td>1GB</td><td>8GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hard Drive</strong></td><td>22GB of Free Space</td><td>22GB of Free Space</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Nintendo Switch</strong></p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Apex-switch.png"                                     ></p><p>On March 9, 2021, EA released a version of this game for Nintendo switch. Currently, it is playable on the switch, and you can only match up with switch players, but soon it will be available to play with cross-platform support. It is a big achievement for EA to make this game playable on a small screen.</p><hr><h4 id="Apex-Legends-Steam-Vs-Origin-What’s-The-Difference"><a href="#Apex-Legends-Steam-Vs-Origin-What’s-The-Difference" class="headerlink" title="Apex Legends: Steam Vs Origin What’s The Difference?"></a><strong>Apex Legends: Steam Vs Origin What’s The Difference?</strong></h4><p>Apex Legends is playable on PC via both <strong>Steam and Origin</strong>. These are basically two different platforms and have their own game launchers. As the game is free to play so you can use either one of them.</p><p>If steam is already installed on your PC then just go to the game store and add Apex Legends to your library. Otherwise, you can also go to Origin game store and get Apex Legends from there. If you compare the performance of game on both platforms then you will find that there isn’t much difference. On origin you may get slightly better performance and fps but the difference of fps is not that much. The game is free to play on both platforms so you can choose according to your comfort and preferences.</p><h4 id="How-to-Choose-Between-These-Platforms"><a href="#How-to-Choose-Between-These-Platforms" class="headerlink" title="How to Choose Between These Platforms"></a><strong>How to Choose Between These Platforms</strong></h4><p>With Apex Legends available on so many platforms, sometimes it can be difficult to choose which platform is best for you. It all depends upon your preferences. If you already have a gaming console like X-box or PS4, you can play it on them. But if you want to play in a competitive environment and get the best gaming experience, then it is only possible on a PC. If you just want to chill with your friends and kill some time, then consoles can do the job for you. For maximum performance, a PC is recommended.</p><p>Bonus：Want to record and edit your wonderful Apex gameplay?

How to disable crossplay? How about cross-progression? Further, which platform is the best to play on? What’s the difference between Steam and Origin?</p><p>In this article, all of the questions above will be answered. No doubt, we have seen a massive increase in the popularity of Apex Legends. Millions of players are grouping in EA’s battle royal game, and it is quite clear why they like it so much. It is a free-to-play game with some quality graphics and gameplay. This game’s core is based around looting and shooting, and it offers a few interesting twists in the battle royal format.</p><hr><h4 id="In-this-article-these-questions-will-be-answered-1"><a href="#In-this-article-these-questions-will-be-answered-1" class="headerlink" title="In this article, these questions will be answered"></a>In this article, these questions will be answered</h4><hr><p>Apex Legends Gameplay Basics:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Apex-gameplay.jpg"                                     ></p><p>In this battle royal game, you are a part of a 3-person squad. There are 14 playable characters to choose from, and they are called legends in the game. If you compare all legends, you will find that they are equal in strength, speed, and firepower. It’s their special abilities that make them different from each other. Every character has a unique ability that can help you in-game to leverage other players. So, you can choose a legend that suits your playstyle and is a perfect fit for your squad.</p><p>Teamwork is very critical in this game. When you jump into the battleground, there are two teammates on your side. Make sure to stick with them during the match if you want to win it. By working together, you can protect each other and outmatch the enemies by combining your abilities. You can stay connected with your teammates using the in-game communication system. You can mark different locations, highlight threats, pinpoint the location of gear pieces, and tell your teammates in which direction you are going.</p><p>There is a ring around the battleground that shrinks after fixed short intervals. As the rink shrinks, it forces the players into a smaller space on the map, and as a result, we observe more fights between different teams. If you want to win the game, then you have to be the last team standing. If your teammates are knocked down, then you can revive them and pick them up. If they are completely killed, you can pick up their banner in a fixed amount of time and have them jumped back into the game once again. This feature makes this game different from other battle royal games where if your teammate dies once, then he stays dead the rest of the game.</p><p>One thing that you must keep in mind while playing this game is that killing an opponent is a bit longer than other FPS (First Person Shooting) games. To kill an opponent, you may need to rely on several headshots, your legends’ unique ability, and the support of your teammates.</p><p>Although this game is free of cost, it offers several in-game purchases. You can purchase Apex Coins, which is an in-game currency. <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Apex-ingame-purchase.jpg"                                     ></p><p>You can use it to purchase loot boxes that contain skins and costumes. There are two locked characters in the game also, and you need to purchase them with Apex coins. So, you can get the maximum out of this game by spending some money and giving time to this game.</p><hr><h4 id="Can-Apex-Legends-crossplay-or-not-1"><a href="#Can-Apex-Legends-crossplay-or-not-1" class="headerlink" title="Can Apex Legends crossplay or not?"></a><strong>Can Apex Legends crossplay or not?</strong></h4><p>Yes, Apex Legends is a cross-platform game. Initially, it wasn’t a cross-platform game, but Apex became a cross-platform game after an update in autumn 2020. It means that two players playing on two different devices can group in a squad and play the game. Let’s explain it with an example. Suppose you have a pc and your friend has a PS4. Both of you can play together in a squad, even if you both have two different types of devices.</p><h4 id="How-to-turn-off-crossplay-1"><a href="#How-to-turn-off-crossplay-1" class="headerlink" title="How to turn off crossplay?"></a><strong>How to turn off crossplay?</strong></h4><p>Firstly, crossplay is enabled by default. Assume now you’re playing apex on PS4&#x2F;switch&#x2F;Xbox using a controller, you might be reluctant to crossplay against a PC player using keyboard and mouse. Because you might think that isn’t fair. So why don’t we turn it off and play only with game console players?</p><p>Step1, to disable it, you need to go to the setting button at the lobby’s right bottom, as shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apex-setting1.png"                      alt="ape-setting1"                ></p><p>Step 2, under the gameplay tab, scroll down, and you can find cross-platform play.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apex-setting2.png"                      alt="apex-setting2"                ></p><h4 id="Does-it-have-cross-progression-1"><a href="#Does-it-have-cross-progression-1" class="headerlink" title="Does it have cross-progression?"></a><strong>Does it have cross-progression?</strong></h4><p>Unfortunately, because of technical and legal issues, no. It means that your characters&#x2F;purchased items will not be synced through platforms. Simply put, you will have to start all over again if you change your platform.</p><hr><h4 id="Which-platform-is-the-best-to-play-on-1"><a href="#Which-platform-is-the-best-to-play-on-1" class="headerlink" title="Which platform is the best to play on?"></a><strong>Which platform is the best to play on?</strong></h4><p>The best thing about Apex Legends is that it has multiplatform support. You can play it on different platforms like:</p><p><strong>Microsoft Xbox One S and X</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/xbox-one.jpg"                                     >You can play Apex Legends on Xbox One S, but you may need to compromise a little bit and play on a low resolution for better fps. Although the game will run just fine, you may need to make some adjustments to your graphics settings. You can play this game on 720p on Xbox One S, so make sure to sit a little closer to your screen to see everything.</p><p>If you want to get Apex’s best experience on Xbox consoles, you should play it on Xbox One X. If you switch from Xbox one S to Xbox one X, you will see a significant difference in the game performance. On the X version, you can run the game on 1080p. It offers overall better performance in terms of gameplay as compared to other Xbox variants.</p><p><strong>Xbox Series X and S</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/xbox-seriesx.jpg"                                     >Xbox series S and X are the latest generations of Xbox. They rival their competitor PS5 and offer competitive performance when you compare these consoles with a PS5. They do offer better gaming performance and better graphics. But, the question is, Can you play Apex on the latest generations of Xbox? The answer is yes. You will get better performance in terms of graphics and FPS but currently, the game isn’t fully optimized for the latest generations. In the coming days it is expected that the game will be optimized for the latest consoles and you can enjoy the game to the fullest. Currently, you can enjoy 1440p gaming on these consoles and can get up to 120fps.</p><p><strong>Sony PlayStation 4</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Apex-ps4.png"                                     >You can also play Apex Legends on Sony PlayStation 4. Although you can play it on the standard PS4, if you want to get the best gaming experience, then you should play it on PS4 Pro. On PS4, you need to have a PlayStation Plus subscription if you want to play online multiplayer games, but in the case of Apex Legends, you do not need it.</p><p><strong>Sony PlayStation 5</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ps5-poster.png"                      alt="ps5-poster"                ></p><p>Sony PlayStation 5 is a next-generation console, and luckily Apex Legends is already playable on it. PS5 offers improved performance and better graphics as compared to its previous versions. If you were previously playing on PS4 and just switched to PS5, you can also retain all your progress and skins on PS5 also. You can use the same EA account and start enjoying Apex Legends on 1440p screen resolution.</p><p><strong>PC</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PC-apex.png"                                     >If you want to do competitive gaming in Apex Legends, then PC is the most suitable choice for you. It is because when you play using a mouse and keyboard instead of controllers, then your aim and movement are more precise. As it is an FPS category game, you can use a monitor with a high refresh rate to have smooth gameplay and reduce the lag. You must keep in mind that you need a PC with some good specs that can provide you with at least 60fps in the game. It would be best if you aim for a PC that can provide you maximum fps. 120 is the most recommended figure here.</p><p>PC Requirements For Apex Legends:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Components</strong></th><th><strong>Minimum</strong></th><th><strong>Recommended</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 7 (64-Bit)</td><td>Windows 7 (64-Bit)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU</strong></td><td>Intel Core i3-6100 or AMD FX-4350</td><td>Intel Core i5-3570K or AMD equivalent</td></tr><tr><td><strong>RAM</strong></td><td>6GB</td><td>8GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GT 640 AMD Radeon HD 7730</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 AMD Radeon R9 290</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU RAM</strong></td><td>1GB</td><td>8GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hard Drive</strong></td><td>22GB of Free Space</td><td>22GB of Free Space</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Nintendo Switch</strong></p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Apex-switch.png"                                     ></p><p>On March 9, 2021, EA released a version of this game for Nintendo switch. Currently, it is playable on the switch, and you can only match up with switch players, but soon it will be available to play with cross-platform support.

The magic button is a control feature in which you don’t see any of the recording controls on-screen through the process of recording a video. If you’re careful you can often edit the recording controls out of any video that you produce but ultimately the paid version comes with more features including editing tools as well. If you just wanted to record a quick android video on screen however, AZ produces extremely smooth HD videos on a huge number of devices that run the Lollipop version of android.</p><h4 id="2-ilos-screen-recorder"><a href="#2-ilos-screen-recorder" class="headerlink" title="2. ilos screen recorder"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.icos.ilos.uploader" >ilos screen recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ilos-screen-recorder.png"                      alt="ilos screen recorder"                ></p><p>This screen recorder offers some benefits because it doesn’t require any type of root on your android device.

This eliminates a lot of the hassles that come with seeing recording controls on-screen during captured videos. In order to download the application currently you have to join their Google plus community and follow the direct link to the Google play store. As the app gains more traction and development it may be able to offer more up to its customers as well as be available for full download into Google play marketplace.</p><h4 id="4-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#4-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="4.Screen Recorder"></a>4.<a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.screenrecorder&hl=en" >Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Screen Record is an app that is a little more complicated than simply hitting a record and stop button on your screen recordings. To activate screen record you need to decide the amount of time that you would like videos to record for. This capture device is actually only good for capturing up to 120 seconds free. In the paid version of the app however you can save much larger videos. By setting the filename as well as the length of recording you can save a variety of MP4 videos to your SD card. Although this is an ideal for longer videos or potentially producing tutorials on your android device it is great for recording very quick clips and moving animations.</p><h4 id="5-Download-manager-for-android"><a href="#5-Download-manager-for-android" class="headerlink" title="5.Download manager for android"></a>5.<a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tt.android.dm.view&hl=en" >Download manager for android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This app is primarily a download manager that you can use in your browser but it comes with featured support for ripping music, video and other files from websites. Enter any linking to the download manager and the media can be saved to your device. This download manager features support for very large file sizes and it features speed up support for optimizing your mobile connection.</p><h4 id="6-SCR-Screen-Recorder-free"><a href="#6-SCR-Screen-Recorder-free" class="headerlink" title="6.

Unfortunately the functionality of this app does require a rooted device and it isn’t currently available to non-root devices. SCR allows you to record both on screen audio as well as audio through the camera microphone. This means that you can record video on the front facing camera as well as have screen capture available for your device as well. The app is still actively in development and the developers will be consistently updating the screen recorder with brand-new development features. They will consistently beat testing the new app and it has perhaps some of the most interesting features for recording tutorial videos out of any screen capture. For $4.99 the full version of this app is well worth a purchase if you plan on recording a lot of screen capture videos.</p><p>Keep these top screen recording apps in mind if you need to record on-screen video with your android device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><h5 id="Liza-Brown-1"><a href="#Liza-Brown-1" class="headerlink" title="Liza Brown"></a>Liza Brown</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>If you plan on recording the actions that you perform on your Android device you’re going to need a good video capture application.

These days, it’s all too common for gamers to have to clear their hard drives when a new game is released.</p><p>Games like Call of Duty see the astonishing patch sizes: Warzone lately may mean you can only update a game rather than get a new one, and still, you’ll run out of space. It is possible to store hundreds of games using an external hard drive, making them available to you without downloading them again.</p><p>You will still need more storage, though an SSD is more efficient and recommended if you buy the Xbox Series S or Series X.</p><p>If you’re looking for a bit more space, we’ve created a list of the best Xbox external hard drives.</p><h2 id="Best-Xbox-External-Hard-Drive-in-2024"><a href="#Best-Xbox-External-Hard-Drive-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Best Xbox External Hard Drive in 2024"></a><strong>Best Xbox External Hard Drive in 2024</strong></h2><h4 id="1-Seagate-2TB-Xbox-Game-Drive"><a href="#1-Seagate-2TB-Xbox-Game-Drive" class="headerlink" title="1.

With this drive, you get a standard Seagate drive in a flashier case. The (admittedly quite nice) embossed Xbox logo and official green case are an additional $15-20. It’s a great choice if the price is right for you, and aesthetics are a concern. Esthetics are important to me, so I think this is the best choice. As often happens around big retail events, Seagate’s 2TB Game Drive in official Xbox green often drops in price, so though this is a great time to buy, we can expect further savings in the coming months.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01065S79E/" >Check on Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Fast and Reliable</li><li>Vast Storage of 2TB</li><li>Compatible with different versions of Xbox.</li><li>It is a value for money hard drive.</li></ul><h4 id="2-WD-Black-P10-1-5TB-Game-Drive"><a href="#2-WD-Black-P10-1-5TB-Game-Drive" class="headerlink" title="2.

The metal topside gives it a bit of a shipping container aesthetic even though it’s not listed as an armored or “rugged” hard drive. The hard drive remains cool even after extensive usage and runs quietly without making any noise.</p><p>Although the drive’s write speed is not special at 130 megabytes per second, we found that it matched the console’s internal hard drive, So you can run the games directly from the hard drive without worrying about any lags or delays.</p><p>The best thing about this hard drive is that you can find it with different storage capacities ranging from 1Tb to 5Tb. So, the users have the option to choose suitable storage options according to their needs.</p><p> <strong>Price:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/WD%5FBlack-Drive-External-Compatible-WDBA3A0050BBK-WESN/dp/B07VNTFHD5" >Check On Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Features</strong>:</p><ul><li>It is extremely portable</li><li>Always runs quietly and cool</li><li>The 3-year warranty is quite reasonable.</li><li>Price is high but is value for money.</li></ul><h4 id="3-Toshiba-1TB-Canvio-Advance"><a href="#3-Toshiba-1TB-Canvio-Advance" class="headerlink" title="3.

With a sleek, glossy design, a simple, elegant design, and a nice blue power-light on top, the Toshiba Canvio Advance is an attractive piece of kit. Works just fine. All the drives on this list match its read and write speeds, and it comes with a two-year warranty. Your Xbox console has a USB port that you can connect to, and proceed as usual…</p><p>Additionally, suppose you want to use it for PCs as well. In that case, it includes password protection and automatic backup of files, both of which make it a better budget pick than our previous budget pick, the Canvio Basics. There is only one real disadvantage to the Advance: it does not come in green, so you cannot match it with your console. Nonetheless, white looks slick next to many Xbox consoles.

These days, it’s all too common for gamers to have to clear their hard drives when a new game is released.</p><p>Games like Call of Duty see the astonishing patch sizes: Warzone lately may mean you can only update a game rather than get a new one, and still, you’ll run out of space. It is possible to store hundreds of games using an external hard drive, making them available to you without downloading them again.</p><p>You will still need more storage, though an SSD is more efficient and recommended if you buy the Xbox Series S or Series X.</p><p>If you’re looking for a bit more space, we’ve created a list of the best Xbox external hard drives.</p><h2 id="Best-Xbox-External-Hard-Drive-in-2024-3"><a href="#Best-Xbox-External-Hard-Drive-in-2024-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Xbox External Hard Drive in 2024"></a><strong>Best Xbox External Hard Drive in 2024</strong></h2><h4 id="1-Seagate-2TB-Xbox-Game-Drive-3"><a href="#1-Seagate-2TB-Xbox-Game-Drive-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

With this drive, you get a standard Seagate drive in a flashier case. The (admittedly quite nice) embossed Xbox logo and official green case are an additional $15-20. It’s a great choice if the price is right for you, and aesthetics are a concern. Esthetics are important to me, so I think this is the best choice. As often happens around big retail events, Seagate’s 2TB Game Drive in official Xbox green often drops in price, so though this is a great time to buy, we can expect further savings in the coming months.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01065S79E/" >Check on Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Fast and Reliable</li><li>Vast Storage of 2TB</li><li>Compatible with different versions of Xbox.</li><li>It is a value for money hard drive.</li></ul><h4 id="2-WD-Black-P10-1-5TB-Game-Drive-3"><a href="#2-WD-Black-P10-1-5TB-Game-Drive-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

The metal topside gives it a bit of a shipping container aesthetic even though it’s not listed as an armored or “rugged” hard drive. The hard drive remains cool even after extensive usage and runs quietly without making any noise.</p><p>Although the drive’s write speed is not special at 130 megabytes per second, we found that it matched the console’s internal hard drive, So you can run the games directly from the hard drive without worrying about any lags or delays.</p><p>The best thing about this hard drive is that you can find it with different storage capacities ranging from 1Tb to 5Tb. So, the users have the option to choose suitable storage options according to their needs.</p><p> <strong>Price:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/WD%5FBlack-Drive-External-Compatible-WDBA3A0050BBK-WESN/dp/B07VNTFHD5" >Check On Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Features</strong>:</p><ul><li>It is extremely portable</li><li>Always runs quietly and cool</li><li>The 3-year warranty is quite reasonable.</li><li>Price is high but is value for money.</li></ul><h4 id="3-Toshiba-1TB-Canvio-Advance-3"><a href="#3-Toshiba-1TB-Canvio-Advance-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

With a sleek, glossy design, a simple, elegant design, and a nice blue power-light on top, the Toshiba Canvio Advance is an attractive piece of kit. Works just fine. All the drives on this list match its read and write speeds, and it comes with a two-year warranty. Your Xbox console has a USB port that you can connect to, and proceed as usual…</p><p>Additionally, suppose you want to use it for PCs as well. In that case, it includes password protection and automatic backup of files, both of which make it a better budget pick than our previous budget pick, the Canvio Basics. There is only one real disadvantage to the Advance: it does not come in green, so you cannot match it with your console. Nonetheless, white looks slick next to many Xbox consoles. You cannot beat the price of the 1TB version, which is around $50 &#x2F; £50.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Canvio-Advance-Portable-External/dp/B08JKFY8FH/" >Check On Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Small and Compact In Size</li><li>Available in multiple colors.</li><li>Extremely affordable.</li><li>Standard speed but matches to that of your console.</li></ul><h4 id="4-Seagate-Expansion-8TB-3"><a href="#4-Seagate-Expansion-8TB-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

The meeting controls will remain available to you while you are sharing the screen so that you can share a new screen, use annotation tools or any of the other available options.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Multiple-Screens-with-Zoom"><a href="#How-to-Share-Multiple-Screens-with-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Multiple Screens with Zoom?"></a>How to Share Multiple Screens with Zoom?</h2><p>Desktop versions of Zoom allow its users to share several screens simultaneously, but the host of the meeting must enable the Dual-Monitors option. After you sign in to your Zoom account, you should click on your profile picture and click on Settings in the drop-down menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-general-settings.jpg"                      alt="  Zoom General Setting Options"                ></p><p>Go to the General tab and click on the checkbox next to the Use Dual Monitors option. In addition, you must disable the Remote Support setting before you start a meeting. Once the meeting starts you should click on the arrow next to the Screen Share icon and pick the Multiple participants can share simultaneously option from the menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-multiple-screens-on-zoom.jpg"                      alt=" Share Multiple Screens on  Zoom "                ></p><p>Once this option is activated all participants will be able to share their screens, although the participants who are using the mobile app to participate in a meeting can only share screens if no one else is sharing their screen.</p><p>The participants in the meeting who are using a dual monitor setup will be able to see two most recently shared screens, while the participants who only have one monitor can only see one screen at the time. Clicking on the View Options will enable you to select the screen you are currently viewing.</p><p>Changing the screen you’re viewing from the Zoom mobile app is not possible. Furthermore, the Share Computer Audio and Optimize for full-screen video clips are unavailable when multiple screens are shared at the same time.</p><h2 id="What-to-Do-If-the-Share-Screen-Option-isn’t-Working"><a href="#What-to-Do-If-the-Share-Screen-Option-isn’t-Working" class="headerlink" title="What to Do If the Share Screen Option isn’t Working?"></a>What to Do If the Share Screen Option isn’t Working?</h2><p>Before you install Zoom on your computer or your Smartphone you must make sure that the app is compatible with the version of the OS your device is using. So, if you can’t find the Screen Share button, you should check if the application is compatible with the operating system.</p><p>Furthermore, Windows users who see only a black screen after they share their screen should switch back to the computer’s integrated graphics. You can do this by going to the Windows Control Panel and selecting the graphic card’s control panel.</p><p>Click on the Manage 3D Settings option and then choose I would like to use the following 3D settings from the Program Settings menu. You should then go to the Select a Program to Customize the menu and add the Cphost.exe file from the Zoom Bin directory.</p><p>Proceed to click on the Add Selected Program, choose the Integrated Graphics setting and click on the Apply button. Head back to Zoom and check if the black screen issue is resolved.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Sharing one or more screens during meetings on Zoom is easy, and it won’t take much more than a few moments of your time, regardless of the device you’re using to run this application. However, you should keep in mind that mobile and web-based versions of the app offer only limited capabilities and that only Mac and PC versions of the app enable users to share multiple screens simultaneously.

Sharing the Screen from an Android Device"></a>3. Sharing the Screen from an Android Device</h3><p>You won’t be able to share the screen with Zoom if you don’t have Android 5.0 or some more recent version of the OS installed on your Smartphone. Tap on the Share icon, after you launch Zoom and pick the Screen option from the menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-screen-zoom-android.jpg"                      alt="Share Screen on Android with Zoom"                ></p><p>Afterward, you should simply tap on the Start Now icon and start sharing the screen along with any application you want with other participants. Optionally, you can use the Annotation tools by tapping on the Annotate icon in the lower-left corner of the meeting window or tap on the Stop Share button if you no longer want to share the device’s screen.</p><h3 id="4-Sharing-the-Screen-on-Macs-and-PCs-3"><a href="#4-Sharing-the-Screen-on-Macs-and-PCs-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Sharing the Screen on Macs and PCs"></a>4. Sharing the Screen on Macs and PCs</h3><p>Using the Zoom’s Share Screen option from Macs and PCs is easy since you just have to click on the Share Screen icon in the meeting toolbar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-screen-zoom-client.jpg"                      alt="Share Screen on  Zoom Client"                ></p><p>You will then be prompted to select the screen you want to share, choose the application that will be shared or opt to share a whiteboard. Click on the Share Computer Sound checkbox in the lower right corner of the window if you want other participants to hear the sounds from your computer. Enable the Optimize for full-screen video clip option in case you want to play a video clip in full screen during the meeting, but make sure that this setting isn’t selected in any other scenario.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-screen-to-share-on-zoom.jpg"                      alt="Select Screen to Share on  Zoom Client"                ></p><p>Click on the Share button when ready and the application will enter the full-screen mode automatically. The meeting controls will remain available to you while you are sharing the screen so that you can share a new screen, use annotation tools or any of the other available options.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Multiple-Screens-with-Zoom-3"><a href="#How-to-Share-Multiple-Screens-with-Zoom-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Multiple Screens with Zoom?"></a>How to Share Multiple Screens with Zoom?</h2><p>Desktop versions of Zoom allow its users to share several screens simultaneously, but the host of the meeting must enable the Dual-Monitors option. After you sign in to your Zoom account, you should click on your profile picture and click on Settings in the drop-down menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-general-settings.jpg"                      alt="  Zoom General Setting Options"                ></p><p>Go to the General tab and click on the checkbox next to the Use Dual Monitors option. In addition, you must disable the Remote Support setting before you start a meeting. Once the meeting starts you should click on the arrow next to the Screen Share icon and pick the Multiple participants can share simultaneously option from the menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-multiple-screens-on-zoom.jpg"                      alt=" Share Multiple Screens on  Zoom "                ></p><p>Once this option is activated all participants will be able to share their screens, although the participants who are using the mobile app to participate in a meeting can only share screens if no one else is sharing their screen.</p><p>The participants in the meeting who are using a dual monitor setup will be able to see two most recently shared screens, while the participants who only have one monitor can only see one screen at the time. Clicking on the View Options will enable you to select the screen you are currently viewing.</p><p>Changing the screen you’re viewing from the Zoom mobile app is not possible. Furthermore, the Share Computer Audio and Optimize for full-screen video clips are unavailable when multiple screens are shared at the same time.</p><h2 id="What-to-Do-If-the-Share-Screen-Option-isn’t-Working-3"><a href="#What-to-Do-If-the-Share-Screen-Option-isn’t-Working-3" class="headerlink" title="What to Do If the Share Screen Option isn’t Working?"></a>What to Do If the Share Screen Option isn’t Working?</h2><p>Before you install Zoom on your computer or your Smartphone you must make sure that the app is compatible with the version of the OS your device is using. So, if you can’t find the Screen Share button, you should check if the application is compatible with the operating system.</p><p>Furthermore, Windows users who see only a black screen after they share their screen should switch back to the computer’s integrated graphics. You can do this by going to the Windows Control Panel and selecting the graphic card’s control panel.</p><p>Click on the Manage 3D Settings option and then choose I would like to use the following 3D settings from the Program Settings menu. You should then go to the Select a Program to Customize the menu and add the Cphost.exe file from the Zoom Bin directory.</p><p>Proceed to click on the Add Selected Program, choose the Integrated Graphics setting and click on the Apply button. Head back to Zoom and check if the black screen issue is resolved.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Sharing one or more screens during meetings on Zoom is easy, and it won’t take much more than a few moments of your time, regardless of the device you’re using to run this application. However, you should keep in mind that mobile and web-based versions of the app offer only limited capabilities and that only Mac and PC versions of the app enable users to share multiple screens simultaneously.

To record more than an hour’s gameplay, you have to opt for PS4 screen recorder on your computer. If you want to ensure superior video quality, and you want to stream your gameplay on Twitch, you will need a Capture Card. In this article, we will illustrate how to record PS4 gameplay with all the available methods.</p><p>Way 1. <a href="#part1">How to Record on PS4 with Built-in Tool</a></p><p>Way 2. <a href="#part2">How to Screen Record on PS4 via PC</a></p><p>Way 3. <a href="#part3">Record Video on PS4 with Capture Card</a></p><h2 id="Way-1-How-to-Record-on-PS4-with-Built-in-Tool"><a href="#Way-1-How-to-Record-on-PS4-with-Built-in-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. How to Record on PS4 with Built-in Tool"></a>Way 1. How to Record on PS4 with Built-in Tool</h2><p>The easiest way on how to record gameplay on PS4 is by using its default recording tool. However, there are certain limitations that you should be aware of. The default PS4 recording time is 15 minutes, and you can adjust the duration up to 60 minutes only. This means you cannot record a gameplay beyond 60 minutes. If you are good with the limitations, you can follow the simple steps on how to record PS4 gameplay for YouTube and Twitch below.</p><p>Step 1: Turn on your PS4 and press Share button. Go to Sharing and Broadcasts option.</p><p>Step 2: Under Sharing and Broadcasts, go to Length of Video Clip option. Here you are set the recording duration up to 60 minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-recording-duration-ps4.jpg"                      alt="set recording duration ps4"                ></p><p>Step 3: If you want to record your gameplay with your voice, go to Audio Sharing Settings option.

The recording will start automatically in the background and as soon as the set duration limit is reached, the recording will stop. However, you can also stop the recording by pressing on Share button twice again.</p><p>Step 5: You can go to the main menu and under Capture Gallery, you will find the recorded video.</p><h2 id="Way-2-How-to-Screen-Record-on-PS4-via-PC"><a href="#Way-2-How-to-Screen-Record-on-PS4-via-PC" class="headerlink" title="Way 2.

Start your gameplay and start recording on your computer.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line-3"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-3" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Hopefully, you have understood how to record videos on PS4. If your gameplay is less than 60 minutes most of the time, you can do the recording with PS4 default screen recorder. However, for professional recording of your gameplay, we recommend you use Filmora to record gameplay on PSA via your computer. You can edit any part of the video and add transitions and video efforts to make it more eye-catching.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"

However, there are certain limitations that you should be aware of. The default PS4 recording time is 15 minutes, and you can adjust the duration up to 60 minutes only. This means you cannot record a gameplay beyond 60 minutes. If you are good with the limitations, you can follow the simple steps on how to record PS4 gameplay for YouTube and Twitch below.</p><p>Step 1: Turn on your PS4 and press Share button. Go to Sharing and Broadcasts option.</p><p>Step 2: Under Sharing and Broadcasts, go to Length of Video Clip option.
