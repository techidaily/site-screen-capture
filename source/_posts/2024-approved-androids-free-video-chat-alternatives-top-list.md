In the age of the global pandemic that was caused by COVID-19, social distancing is one of the best ways to prevent this infamous disease from spreading. [Video chat apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) allow us to keep in touch with our friends and family during these difficult times without jeopardizing anyone’s safety. Mac, iPhone, or iPad users don’t have to think much about which video chat app they are going to choose as FaceTime is both free and easy to use.

Android operating systems don’t come with FaceTime’s equivalent, which is the reason why their users have to find a video chat app that best suits their needs. So, in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best free FaceTime for Android alternatives.

![ FaceTime Alternative: Snapchat  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-video-chat.jpg)

With a user base of more than 210 million people, Snapchat is easily one of the best video chat apps for Android and iPhones. Besides giving you the option to video chat with 16 friends at the same time, Snapchat also offers the possibility to send video snaps or photos that disappear just seconds after you sent them to all of your contacts.

However, calling landlines or mobile phones that don’t have Snapchat installed is impossible, as you can only use this app to video chat with people who are already using it. Doodling over the video while the call is still in progress, applying or creating photo and video filters and discovering where your friends hang out are just a few among countless options Snapchat provides.

#### Can an Android Chat with an iPhone?

Yes, of course, although you can’t use FaceTime, because the app is not compatible with the Android operating system. Installing any of the apps we featured in this article will enable you to communicate with iPhone owners for free, although they will also have the app through which you want to reach them installed on their smartphones. Some video chats also offer the option to call landlines and mobile phones, but this option is not free, and you must find out the rates for the destinations you want to call.

**Conclusion**

Finding the alternative to FaceTime won’t take too long, as there are so many different video chat apps you can use to organize conference calls or group chats. Skype, Facebook Messenger, or Google Duo are some of the most obvious choices, even though millions of people are using apps like WhatsApp, Viber, or WeChat to video chat with their friends and family.
