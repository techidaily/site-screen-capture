Many individuals wonder if they can privately chat on Google Meet, however that option is not possible in the Google Meet chat feature till now. Any and all messages or links that individuals share during a conference on Google Meet are shared with all the participants who are in the meeting during that time.

For instance, if a participant leaves a meeting and you send a message when they have left, then that participant joins again, the participant will not be able to receive or view your message. However, all those present in the session while the message was sent can read it. There is no option to create a private chat on Google Meet as of now.

## Part 5: How to Change Google Meet Chat Font Size?

Google Meet comes fully equipped with numerous features and functions, however, changing the chat font size is not one of them. Participants cannot make any changes to the font of messages sent in the chatbox. They cannot increase the size, spacing, font style, or color of the messages that are being sent. While these options are available in other Google Application features such as Gmail and more. They are still yet to come into play on Google Meet.
