OBS Studio (Open Broadcaster Software) is an application that allows you to record your video games and broadcast yourself over the Internet using sites such as the popular Twitch TV. You don't have a dedicated webcam or costly streaming camera? Whatever your purpose may be, you simply wish to employ your Android mobile phones or tablet computer's built-in camera using Open Broadcaster Software
