## Prime 7 Free Screen Recorders for Old Computers

Screen recording, now a days is in high demand because of monetized work on social media, from which people around, are making a good lot of money. For screen recording, a number of different things are rudimentary: skills to show, video editing, quality content, concise and clear message. Now, the skill is something that we cannot teach you but for the remaining aspects the screen recorder applications are used, which, not only record the screen but most of them offer video editing and other operations on the files.

With all these screen recorders, a specific hardware is required in the computer to support the application and run it smoothly. Screen recorders, with normally a wide range of operations and editing functions, are quite heavy for the computers to run. This problem normally is encountered by people with low end pc.
