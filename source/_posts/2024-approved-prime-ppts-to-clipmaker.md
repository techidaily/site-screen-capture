Three decades after Microsoft PowerPoint was initially released in May 1990, this presentation software has become a symbol of professionalism and excellence. However, there are quite a few downsides to traditional PPT files, PowerPoint produces because the contents of your presentations can be easily modified and used by someone else.

The 2010 and later versions of PowerPoint have addressed this issue by including the Save to Video option that enabled users to create video files which can be easily posted on social media, video sharing platforms or used in eLearning courses. The built-in PPT file conversion option featured in recent versions of PowerPoint has certain limitations that prevent you from choosing the video file format or including inserted media files in the PowerPoint presentation video.

That's the reason why we've gathered 10 best PPT to video converters that make the process of producing a video from a PowerPoint presentation easy and fun.

## Tips for Choosing PPT to Video Converter Software

Investing your money wisely is always a good idea because the most expensive solution is often not the best solution. The same is true for PPT to Video converter software, so before you go ahead and choose the program you will be using to convert your PowerPoint presentations into videos here are a few tips that will help you make up your mind.

Checking the amount of video file formats supported by the software is the key step towards selecting the right converter because it will give you the versatility the PowerPoint's built-in PPT to video converter lacks. What's more, some of the programs for PPT to video file conversions don't allow you to convert audio files or animations into videos, which can ruin the original presentation, so prior to buying a software make sure that it can turn multimedia files into videos as well.

Last, but certainly not the least, try to determine whether or not the software is cost-effective because there is absolutely no point in spending a lot of money on a software that has the same PPT to video file conversion capabilities as PowerPoint.

## Tips for Choosing PPT to Video Converter Software

Investing your money wisely is always a good idea because the most expensive solution is often not the best solution. The same is true for PPT to Video converter software, so before you go ahead and choose the program you will be using to convert your PowerPoint presentations into videos here are a few tips that will help you make up your mind.

Checking the amount of video file formats supported by the software is the key step towards selecting the right converter because it will give you the versatility the PowerPoint's built-in PPT to video converter lacks. What's more, some of the programs for PPT to video file conversions don't allow you to convert audio files or animations into videos, which can ruin the original presentation, so prior to buying a software make sure that it can turn multimedia files into videos as well.

Last, but certainly not the least, try to determine whether or not the software is cost-effective because there is absolutely no point in spending a lot of money on a software that has the same PPT to video file conversion capabilities as PowerPoint.

 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

Three decades after Microsoft PowerPoint was initially released in May 1990, this presentation software has become a symbol of professionalism and excellence. However, there are quite a few downsides to traditional PPT files, PowerPoint produces because the contents of your presentations can be easily modified and used by someone else.

The 2010 and later versions of PowerPoint have addressed this issue by including the Save to Video option that enabled users to create video files which can be easily posted on social media, video sharing platforms or used in eLearning courses. The built-in PPT file conversion option featured in recent versions of PowerPoint has certain limitations that prevent you from choosing the video file format or including inserted media files in the PowerPoint presentation video.

That's the reason why we've gathered 10 best PPT to video converters that make the process of producing a video from a PowerPoint presentation easy and fun.
