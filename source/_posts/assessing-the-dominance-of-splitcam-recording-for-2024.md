## 3\. In-depth Review

Let us move on to the detailed SplitCam review and analyze how it performs on the parameters that matter the most.

Performance: SplitCam is not as heavy an application as some of the professional video recorders. Hence, it does not put much pressure on CPU resource. Since the video recording quality is restricted, even at the highest resolution, performance is smooth.

Video Quality: The video quality is restricted to maximum of 2048x1536 resolution. Therefore, you cannot shoot 4K videos even though your webcam or desktop screen has 4K resolution. Hence, there is a scope for improvement in video quality which is why users look for other SplitCam similar software.

Support Devices: You can record your external webcam, desktop screen, as well as IP camera. Besides, it supports NDI devices. However, the software is only available for Windows 7 and Windows 10.

Editing Options: There are different customization options available for adjusting video parameters such as brightness, saturation, and even skin smoother. However, it lacks editing options post-recording so that you could take the video to the next level.
