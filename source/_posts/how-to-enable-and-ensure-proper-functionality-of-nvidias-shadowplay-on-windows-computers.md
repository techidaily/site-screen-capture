## Fix 4: Enable VSync

 VSync is a graphics technology that synchronizes the frame rate of a game with a monitor’s refresh rate. If your PC is suffering from screen tearing, enabling VSync can be an effective fix.

 Some PC gamers reported that by turning on VSync, the game stopped crashing. If you didn’t enable VSync, you should give it a shot.

 To turn on VSync in Nvidia graphics card, just open **Nvidia Control Panel** , then go to **Manage 3D Settings** \> **Program Settings** , then add **SnowRunner** . Scroll down to set **VSync** to **ON** . Then launch SnowRunner to enable VSync at in-game graphics settings.

 Launch the game and see if this fix works. If the game still crashes, just try the next fix, below.

## Fix 5: Close CPU / memory hogging applications

 Another common cause of SnowRunner crashes is insufficient memory. If there’re lots of applications running in the background at the same time, your computer may run out of RAM and the game may crash.

1. On your keyboard, press **Ctrl** , **Shift** and **Esc** at the same time to open **Task Manager** . You will be prompted for permission. Click **Yes** to open Task Manager.
2. Select any other applications and programs that take up a large amount of **CPU** or **memory** , then click **End task** to close it.
