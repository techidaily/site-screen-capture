## 4\. Best Screencastify Alternatives

Although the Screencastify extension is a great tool with a dozen of export configurations and editing tools, its usage is limited to the Google Chrome web browser and if you are using any other application for surfing on the internet, then this application is pretty much useless to you.

However, if you need a screen recorder or a video editing application, then the following are some of the best ones available out there.

### 1\. Screencast-O-Matic

Now you can click the start button to record a video and after you are done you can instantly edit it to change the contrast, brightness, and many more. And then you will be able to export it to your desired quality.

### 3\. Filmora

Filmora is another application that can be a great alternative to Screencastify because of its robust tools and efficient user interface. It has become a popular name for video recording as well as editing applications amongst users. The main reason for its popularity is because of its availability in different operating systems. Also, Filmora is embedded in key editing tools such as cropping, adjusting the contrast, brightness, and other key features as well as trimming and cutting the videos.
