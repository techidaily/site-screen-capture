If you are using an iPhone with iOS 11 or higher, you can use the default screen recorder feature available to record WhatsApp call. However, if your iPhone has iOS lower than 11, you can either update iOS to 11 or use a WhatsApp video call recorder. Otherwise, you can connect your iPhone to Mac, and you can use QuickTime Player to record WhatsApp video call.

Using iOS Inbuilt Screen Recorder -

Use QuickTime Player on Mac -

Step 3: Choose iPhone as the microphone source and click on Record button.

Step 4: On your iPhone, make WhatsApp call with your chosen person, and QuickTime will be recording the conversation.
