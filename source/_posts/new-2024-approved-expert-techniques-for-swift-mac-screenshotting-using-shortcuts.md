**Step 4: Edit and Save Your Recordings**

After you're done with the recording, hit the Stop button and go through the Video Editor features to utilize them to the best extent.

Afterwards, to share your work of art straightforwardly to YouTube or some other renowned stage, go for the Export button and select the platform to share your video recording.

## Conclusion

A screen recorder is an instrument that catches content on your Mac screen and saves it in video or screen capture design. Luckily, the Mac has an inherent screen recording device that you can begin pretty quick but it lacks several features. Hence, with Filmora as a method for aiding the watcher centre, you approach the zoom-in highlight while recording other than the choice to draw and incorporate subtitles were vital. Sound from the amplifier (portrayal) or potentially framework sound can likewise be caught at the same time with the video.
