![stardew-valley-ginger-island-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-poster.png)

Before we delve into all you need to know about the intriguing game known as Stardew Valley Ginger Island, there are things you must note. Understand that Stardew Valley is regarded as a simulation role-playing video game. This video game was developed by no one else but Eric Barone. While it was released in February 2016 for Microsoft Windows, it later made its debut in:

* Xbox one
* PlayStation Vita
* iOS
* Android
* MacOS
* Linux, and even;
* PlayStation 4

Are you wondering what makes this game interesting? Well, players tend to act as a character who takes complete control over their late grandfather's already dilapidated farm. And, this farm is located in a place known as Stardew Valley. It must be noted that this game is entirely open-ended as it enables players to take on diverse activities. These activities include:

* Ore mining
* Growing of crops
* Raising some livestock
* Selling of produce, and;
* Crafting of goods

More so, your character will get to socialize with the people in the town, proceed to marry, and even have kids. Note that roughly three other players can play this game together online. In other news, Stardew Valley has been regarded over time as a masterpiece. It is filled with a relaxing vibe, romance, and, of course, adventure.

For those interested, the game begins with you, a box of parsnip seeds, and some handy tools. Bear in mind that Stardew Valley has a lot to offer its players. And, the addition of Ginger Island has made the game very popular. Understand that with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, players have begun new farms and are trying to grow tropical produce to make a profit. If you never knew, Stardew Valley Ginger Island is filled with fun activities as well as puzzles.

## **Stardew Valley Ginger Island**

It must be clearly stated that Stardew Valley Ginger Island is where the majority of the new content of Stardew Valley takes place. If you never knew, the 1.5 update of Stardew Valley has a whole lot to offer, ranging from new items, areas, places to build your farm, and even some new characters.

Above all, Ginger Island is most likely the most significant part of the Stardew Valley 1.5 update. For those who are just starting with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, things may get quite awkward. However, those who already play the Stardew Valley game will be capable of venturing into the quests and solving them. To proceed to Stardew Valley Ginger Island, you will need to restore the community center. Note that this particular task will get players closer to being capable of visiting Ginger Island. However, to restore the community center, you will need to create bundles for no one else but the Junimos. The Junimos are found living inside the community center. By creating all the bundles for the Junimos, they will assist you in restoring the community center. When you are done repairing the community center, you will need to be capable of helping Willy fix his already old boat.

![stardew-valley-ginger-island-location](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-location.jpg)

Immediately you meet the requirements of restoring the community center and fixing willy's boat. When you get to the Ginger Island while playing the Stardew Valley Ginger Island game, you will meet Leo. The first thing to know about Leo is that he is a shy person though he is not interested in the player. As a shy person, he befriends both animals and players subtly. When he befriends you, he can begin considering making a move into town. The move to town will make Leo more accessible. In all, Leo is simply a child that will manage to successfully befriend Jas and Vincent whenever he is fully settled in the new home in the Stardew Valley Ginger Island game.

## **Features in Stardew Valley Ginger Island**

Some of the intriguing addition players will love in Stardew Valley Ginger Island include:

### 1.Volcano dungeon

![stardew-valley-ginger-island-volcano-dungeon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-volcano-dungeon.jpg)

This is regarded as an enormous draw for adventurous players. It is lava-filled, and players will encounter nine new enemies, lots of new items, a shop, and a forge. Please do not mistake the Volcano dungeon for the skull cavern as they fi crib differently. If you want to pass through the Volcano dungeon successfully, you will need to solve some puzzles. Also, you will need to make use of the watering can to traverse the lava successfully.

### 2.The Island trader

![stardew-valley-ginger-island-the-island-trader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-the-island-trader.jpg)

Among the first things, every farmer will have on their to-do list is to get a hold of some elements on the Island. You can do this easily in the Stardew Valley Ginger Island if you are ready to put in the work to find the golden walnuts. When you restore the Island farmhouse, you can pay ten golden walnuts to build the trader's hut. From here, you can purchase tropical crop seeds and any other unique items.

### 3.Pirates and Mermaids

![stardew-valley-ginger-island-pirates-and-mermaids](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-pirates-and-mermaids.jpg)

Does it surprise you that there are mermaids on the Stardew Valley Ginger Island? Well, these mermaids seem to appear on Ginger Island. Aside from the mermaids, you will find a pirate cove filled with pirates. When you converse with the mermaids and pirates, you can unlock some items for your farm.

### 4.Fossil Donations

![stardew-valley-ginger-island-fossil-donations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-fossil-donations.jpg)

Stardew Valley Ginger Island is the home of lots of fossils as players are expected to dig them up. When they are dug, the fossils are carried to Dr. Snail and further donated. When you complete the fossils, you will be given golden walnuts. The golden walnuts take the role of currency of the Stardew Valley Ginger Island game.

### 5.Dig site

It is practically a tropical version of the quarry but with some quirks. You will find a mushroom cave positioned near it. And when you are inside, you will find the NPC, Dr. Snail. Bear in mind that this site is capable of spawning mahogany trees and nodes daily. It makes it suitable for farming. When you free Dr. Snail from this vicinity, the Island field office will be unlocked, and the power to donate fossils will be provided.

### 6.New farm

![stardew-valley-ginger-island-new-farm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-new-farm.jpg)

If you love the tropical vibe of Stardew Valley Ginger Island, you can get to settle there. Though it will take some work, the farm can be successfully set up on the Island so that you can live there.

### 7.Qi's Walnut Room

![stardew-valley-ginger-island-walnut-room](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-walnut-room.png)

For those unaware, Qi is the mysterious figure that had the powers to give out huge rewards in this game. Once you collect up to one hundred walnuts, the room will be wide open with plenty of goodies within it. However, the gems of Qi will have to be earned so that you can buy items from the shop.
