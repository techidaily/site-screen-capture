### Method 1: Using IP Webcam App via Wi-Fi

Google Play grants you access to a lot of different webcam apps, but most of them don't provide a high-quality service. [**IP Webcam**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&hl=en) application performs better than most of its competitors, and it enables you to quickly connect your phone to your computer through the Wi-Fi connection.

#### Step 1 Connect to Same Wi-Fi Network

In order to turn your Android phone into a webcam, you'll first have to connect both your computer and your Smartphone to the same Wi-Fi network.

#### Step 2 Connect to Same Wi-Fi Network

Once you've accomplished this, you can proceed to download and install the IP Webcam app on your Android device. Make sure that all other apps on your phone are closed and launch the IP Webcam application.

We recommend you to set up your login and password in Local Broadcasting under Connection Settings Tab for security reasons.

![IP Webcam settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ip-webcam-settings.jpg)

Locate the Start Server feature within the app, tap on it and the app will show you a URL.

#### Step 3 Connect IP Webcam via Chrome/FireFox

Insert the URL displayed on your phone's screen into Chrome or FireFox web browser on your computer and press Enter.

Now that the new webpage is loaded, you should look for a Video Render drop-down menu and select the Browser option. Head over to the Audio Render menu and click on the HTML wav feature. After completing these steps, you can start a recording session directly from the web browser you're using by clicking the Record button.

You can also copy the URL displayed by on the phone's screen into the VLC Media Player to record the video.

That’s how to turn your Android phone as a webcam to record video by using the IP Webcam app. You can also download the IP Webcam Adapter on your computer too and then use your Android as a video source for Skype video chat. Check the video made by CNET and find out the specific steps.

### Method 2: Using DroidCam App via USB Connection

Enabling the Developer mode on your Android device is the first step you'll have to take if you would like to turn your phone into a webcam via the USB port. Once you are in the Developer Mode you have to switch on the USB Debugging option. Here's how you can do this.

#### Step 1 Enable Developer Mode on Android

Open the Settings menu on your Android phone and tap on the About Phone feature. You'll be able to see the Build Number option, tap on it several times and the Developer Mode on your phone will be enabled.

#### Step 2 Download DroidCam on Android and PC

Go to the Google Play Store and download the [**DroidCam**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dev47apps.droidcam&hl=en) application to your phone, and repeat the same process from your computer. You can find the installation for the PC version of the DroidCam app at this [**link**](http://www.dev47apps.com/droidcam/windows/).

#### Step 3 Connect Android and PC

Connect the Android device to a computer via the USB cable. Make sure that the app is open on your Android phone and your computer, and then click on the USB tab in the app you've launched from your computer.

![Droidcam Client](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/droidcam-client.jpg)

You can also switch to the Wi-Fi connection if you prefer. But to make it work, you need to ensure that the DroidCam and your PC are using the same wireless network.

Clicking on the Start icon will enable you to gain access to the phone's camera. If everything seems to be in order, you can commence the webcam video recording session.

You just have to download the drivers to a Mac or PC computer and you can start a live video chat. However, the basic version of the app offers limited options, so if you want to enjoy the full capacity of this app, you should download the EpocCAM HD.

Besides turning your iPhone into a webcam, this app also lets you use a flashlight when recording in difficult light conditions, as well as to adjust the focus or fine-tune the audio recording settings.

### Method 2: Using WebCamera App to Turn iPhone into a Webcam
