Features:

* Custom sticker making, a gallery and a time capsule feature from your memories

* Everything that Facebook has, but marketed at a younger age group

Pros:

* They incorporate a healing kit and health tracking data app

Cons:

* Most definitely not the best business video call chat for iPhone.
