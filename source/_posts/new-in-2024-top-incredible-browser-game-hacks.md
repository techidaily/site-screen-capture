Although the graphics quality of this game is above average, most players rate it lower due to messy motion detection and ball physics abilities.

This game can be played in two different modes; you can either switch to the multiplayer mode or the arcade mode. You need to collect maximum points by directing your shots very carefully and target your basket perfectly to move to the next level.

## Best Free Webcam Games for PC and Laptop

Here is a top-rated collection of various short duration flash games that work online and support webcam-based operations. In order to make your characters do something on the screen, you need to move your limbs, especially arms in a specific direction with exact motion so that desired job can be done. In one part of this game, players need to block the snowballs to defend his snow castle, and it can be done by moving hands in both directions. One more addition to this series is more interesting where the player needs to pop the green bubbles available on the screen while saving the red ones.

You will love the graphics, background music and animations of this game. But note that its ability to sense your limb movements completely depends on the webcam quality. The great news for crazy gamers is that it is a two-player game where his player can have his personal paddle on one portion of the screen.
