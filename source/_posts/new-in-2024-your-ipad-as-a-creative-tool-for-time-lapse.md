If you own an iPad, you can create stunning timelapse videos easily. All the modern iPad variants have the timelapse feature. You can create short timelapse videos of any event and put them on social media platforms. Besides, adding a timelapse video to a regular video enhances the content. We will illustrate how to record iPad time lapse in simple steps.

Apple claims that iPad can record 30 hours of time-lapse video. You have to consider the battery charge and the storage space on your iPad. These important factors can limit the recording duration of your time-lapse video. The longer the duration of the time-lapse, the lower will be the frame rate.

**How long is a 1 hour time lapse on iPhone?**

When the recording duration is one hour in timelapse mode, iPhone frame capture rate is 1 frame per second. This means a 1-hour time lapse on iPhone will be 4 minutes.
