## Part 2\. How to Record a WhatsApp Call on Android?

WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app among Android users. WhatsApp has literally replaced text messaging and its free audio call feature is widely used as an alternative to traditional call. At the same time, users prefer WhatsApp video call over audio call for personal communication with contacts.
