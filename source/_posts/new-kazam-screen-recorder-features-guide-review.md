## 4\. Our Take on Kazam Ubuntu Recorder

Kazam allows you to record in different document designs (WEBM, AVI, MP4 and others). For staying away from the capacity issue while recording, the most ideal choice is the MP4\. I additionally unequivocally suggest staying away from the RAW (AVI) design (except if you're completely mindful of what you're doing) as even the recording several minutes can create GBs of recorded information. There is additionally another choice present for taking screen captures in Kazam. At the point when you start screen recording,

The main serious issue with Kazam is the absence of help for recording through a webcam. Even though, in case you simply need to utilize Kazam for catching screens and taking screen captures, it is the best decision for fledglings. Kazam is an extraordinary screen recorder that is extremely simple to learn. Kazam is genuinely a monster as far as elements and effortlessness.
