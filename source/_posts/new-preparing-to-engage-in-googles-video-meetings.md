## Part 1: How to Join A Google Meet from the Meet Website?

While many suggest that you need to be a G Suite member to access Google Meet, you do not need to be a member to join a session.

Once you have opened the website on your laptop or desktop, all you need to do is simply copy the meeting code or link that has been sent to you by the host of the session and paste it into the “Enter a code or link” text box.
