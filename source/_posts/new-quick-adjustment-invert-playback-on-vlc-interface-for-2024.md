## Part 1\. How to Rotate Video in VLC on Windows

There are various reasons why you may want to rotate a video. It could be that the video has been taken at the wrong angle or you want to watch the video at a certain angle from a different perspective. The most common reason is that the video is taken in portrait mode and it looks small on your computer screen with black screen on both sides and you want to rotate the video to landscape mode. Here are the steps to perform VLC rotate video.

Step 1: Open VLC Media Player.

Step 2: Go to Media > Open File option and select the video file that you want to rotate.

Step 3: Once the video opens, go to Tools > Effects and Filters option.

![vlc tools option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-tools-option.jpg)

Step 4: From Adjustments and Effects window, go to Video Effects tab.

Step 5: Under Video Effects tab, go to Geometry tab.

Step 6: Check Transform option and from the drop-down menu, select the required options.

The options available are – rotate by 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, flip horizontally or vertically, transport and anti-transpose.

In order to disable this rotation effect, follow the same steps and this time, uncheck Transform and Rotate options.

## Part 2\. How to Rotate Video in VLC on Mac

If you want VLC rotate video and save feature so that the video’s rotation angle changes permanently, take the following steps on Windows.

Step 1: Open VLC player and open the video file.

Step 2: Follow all the steps we have mentioned on Method 1 - How to rotate video in VLC on Windows?

Wait patiently for the process to get over and you can check the destination folder for the permanently rotated file.

Step 10: You are back on Convert Window and finally, select a Destination File to save the new rotated video file and click on Start button.

Wait patiently for the process to get over and you can check the destination folder for the permanently rotated file.

Please note that this permanent rotation feature on VLC is only available for Windows users. Mac users are yet to get the feature and you can hope to see this permanent rotation feature in upcoming versions of VLC Media Player for MAC.

## Part 4\. Alternative Way to Rotate Videos Permanently

## The Bottom Line

VLC Media Player is a great tool to rotate any video at any desired angle. You can make this rotation temporary for momentary viewing purpose as well as make the rotation effect permanent so that it always opens with the set rotation effect. However, the steps to rotate permanently on VLC are somewhat complex. Therefore, we recommend Wondershare Filmora where you can rotate any video permanently in three simple steps.
