### 10\. Screenr

Screenr is remarkable because it excels in the annotation. Annotating is a hard thing to get right without confusing the user.

**Pros**:

* This is a high-performing platform that is programmed for speed.
* One-click capture and share of annotations.
* A significant focus on document annotations that make it clean-cut and professional.

### 11. [Bewisse](https://record.bewisse.com/)

**Pros**:

* You don’t need to set up an account with them, log in, or give away any details.
* There is no installation required to use it.
* It is entirely free to use.

**Cons**:

* It’s a little on the primary side.
* It only works if you have a Firefox or Chrome browser.

### 11. [Bewisse](https://record.bewisse.com/)

Lewis is a smart-but-friendly looking free online screen recorder service that is entirely free. Unfortunately, it isn’t compatible with the Microsoft Edge internet browser, which is weird. Programmed to run with Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, Bewisse perhaps works best with Apple or Mac OS’s. However, they have a great free screenshot capture feature that doesn’t need a login.

**Pros**:

* You don’t need to set up an account with them, log in, or give away any details.
* There is no installation required to use it.
* It is entirely free to use.

## Conclusion

Screen recorders have become essential since we live in an age where people love to make videos, watch videos, and share videos. And getting a free online platform makes the recording process easier. Therefore, we presented you with some free online screen recorders with their pros and cons so that it will be easier for you to find out the best for you and according to your needs. So, start creating your own masterpiece with these free online screen capture tools.

The slides in presentations often contain just the most important information about the topics presentations cover. They serve as talking points the presenter uses to make an argument or start a discussion, but the implications of different points can be unclear without an in-depth explanation.

[Recording a PowerPoint presentation](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a simple solution to this problem, as you can take your audience through each slide without having to leave your home. So, in this article, we will show you how to record a PowerPoint presentation with audio and video.
