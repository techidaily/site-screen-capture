It's now possible to choose a game to play after having BIOS installed. The PS2 BIOS will then be requested. Return to tapping the game after selecting the BIOS file. After you've done this, all you have to do is wait for the program to load so that you can begin playing.

**What is the standard frame rate for PlayStation 2 games?**
