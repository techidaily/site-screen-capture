## Tips for Transcribe Zoom Meeting Recordings

Although the programs discussed above are efficient in their own way, they can generate accurate transcription only if the source files are healthy. Following are a few tips you must keep in mind while recording a Zoom meeting for transcription:

#### Tip 1: Get a Clear Audio Recording

Make sure that you follow the best practices about the input and output device placements and positioning suggested by Zoom professionals. While using a smartphone, ensure that it has enough battery to last at least for a couple of hours, and doesn’t exhaust during the meeting. For laptops, it is advisable to use an average quality headset with a microphone instead of onboard speakers and mic.

#### Tip 2: Meeting Transcription Software Security

While subscribing for any third-party transcription service, make sure to check their privacy policies and confirm if they are agreeable. Since you will be uploading quite sensitive information that may contain your trade secrets, only the service provider with good privacy policy and robust encryption algorithms should be allowed to handle your files.

**Conclusion**

**Zoom transcriptions**  come in handy when you plan to discuss some crucial matters in a meeting, and want all the details to be documented with proper timestamps. In case it is a video conference that is to be recorded, you can choose a service provider that offers close and open captioning as well.

## Tips for Transcribe Zoom Meeting Recordings

Although the programs discussed above are efficient in their own way, they can generate accurate transcription only if the source files are healthy. Following are a few tips you must keep in mind while recording a Zoom meeting for transcription:

#### Tip 1: Get a Clear Audio Recording

Make sure that you follow the best practices about the input and output device placements and positioning suggested by Zoom professionals. While using a smartphone, ensure that it has enough battery to last at least for a couple of hours, and doesn’t exhaust during the meeting. For laptops, it is advisable to use an average quality headset with a microphone instead of onboard speakers and mic.

#### Tip 2: Meeting Transcription Software Security

While subscribing for any third-party transcription service, make sure to check their privacy policies and confirm if they are agreeable. Since you will be uploading quite sensitive information that may contain your trade secrets, only the service provider with good privacy policy and robust encryption algorithms should be allowed to handle your files.

**Conclusion**

**Zoom transcriptions**  come in handy when you plan to discuss some crucial matters in a meeting, and want all the details to be documented with proper timestamps. In case it is a video conference that is to be recorded, you can choose a service provider that offers close and open captioning as well.
