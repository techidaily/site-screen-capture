Screencasting on any version of Windows 7/8/10 is a simple task, and countless software products enable you to record your desktop activities.

Most screen recorders create MP4 or MOV files that can get quite large, making them hard to send or easily distribute over the Internet.

On the other hand, GIFs are small in size, and sending them via email or posting them on social media networks won't require you to wait for a long time until the file is uploaded to the web.

You should hold and drag the left mouse button to select the portion of the screen you'd like to record, and then hit the Record button below the screen capturing frame you've created.

Click on the Stop button to finish the screen capturing session, and then wait for the video to be uploaded to Recordit's server. Clicking on the notification that informs you that the video was successfully uploaded will take you to its online destination.

Play the file and click on the GIF button to convert the video file into a GIF. You can either download the file you've created or use its URL to share it on social networks.
