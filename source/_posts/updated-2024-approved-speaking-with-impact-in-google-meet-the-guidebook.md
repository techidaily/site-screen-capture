Getting tired of all the messages being shared across the Google Meet session? Sending too many messages can be quite distracting.

So, if you are wondering **how to turn off chat in Google Meet** sessions, the answer to that is quite simple. Check it out below!

First, join a Google Meet session that you are hosting. Remember, to make use of this feature you must be a host of the meeting.

## Part 8: How to Retrieve Google Meet Chat History?

Unlike Google Hangouts, individuals cannot retrieve chats on Google Meet. Once the call has ended the chat is automatically deleted. Unless the [video meeting is recorded](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with a Google Workspace account, the chat in Google Meet is archived.

**Are You Ready to Use the Chat Feature on Google Meet?**

Making use of the Google Meets chat feature can be extremely handy and helpful if a participant in a meeting wants to convey a message, but does not want to interrupt the session. Individuals can share messages, links, and emojis with all participants in the session. Not only that, but individuals can use the chat feature on their laptops as well as their mobile devices. The chat feature is very easy to make use of, just follow a few simple steps and you will be good to go!
