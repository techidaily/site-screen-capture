Apple claims that iPad can record 30 hours of time-lapse video. You have to consider the battery charge and the storage space on your iPad.

**How long is a 1 hour time lapse on iPhone?**

When the recording duration is one hour in timelapse mode, iPhone frame capture rate is 1 frame per second. This means a 1-hour time lapse on iPhone will be 4 minutes.
