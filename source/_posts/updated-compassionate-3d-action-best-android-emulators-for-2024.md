Would you like to play the classic Nintendo 3DS games on your latest android devices? This article is meant for you if that's the case!

The days of buying dedicated handheld consoles to fulfill entertainment needs on the go are long gone. The Gameboy, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation Vita, and Sony's PSP were the most commonly used gaming consoles a decade ago. As times change, we increasingly rely on our smartphones for a variety of activities. Smartphones are now so powerful that they can replace laptops and desktop computers because of their chipsets. Gaming on the go is by far the most intriguing development of smartphones.

Nintendo 3DS is certainly at the top of the list of most popular handheld gaming consoles, perhaps alongside the PSP and Gameboy. It is undeniable that the Nintendo 3DS has some of the greatest classic games of all time, and one can totally understand why people might be tempted to pick one up - even in 2024\. Since our smartphones are easily accessible, buying a new device just to play games that are already available would be a waste of resources. Using emulators, you are able to play games developed for other hardware on your phone.

If you search on google for the best 3DS emulators for Android, you will have limitless options, and you can easily get confused among so many choices, such as RetroArch, DraStic DS Emulator, NDS4droid, etc. We are lending you a helping hand as we have prepared a list of top 10 3ds emulators that you can use on your android smartphones and have the classic gaming experience.

**Price:** Free

Citra 3DS Emulator is one of the best Android 3DS emulators, but it has not been officially released yet. Therefore you must use an unofficial version of the APK. Whatever the case, the emulator is regarded as the best on Android and contains a wealth of features. It can be easily downloaded and installed and it can be enhanced with more features, games, or ROMs since it is open-source. It is created using Dolphin Emulator, which means old school gamers will enjoy it. Throughout its GUI, it offers the best configuration and settings controls.

**Price:** Free

This emulator has an intriguing name and does not appear good at first glance, but it is really good. A lot of sensors are used in their faster emulation, which makes the power consumption lower compared to other emulators. It is literally the best 3DS Android Emulator available, as it supports almost all games for Gameboy Advance and Nintendo 3DS. Both external and wireless controllers are supported.

On this emulator, cheat codes can also be used or disabled while playing Nintendo 3DS games. The backend has OpenGL in order to reduce the damage done to the GPU. It also has a fast-forward feature. In addition, the emulator has a clean graphical user interface which not many emulators possess, so we recommend it.

**Pros:**

* Works with GBA and 3DS games
* Emulation of gyros, tilts, soars, and rumble
* It consumes less power thanks to faster emulation

**Cons:**

* Bloated & slow with lots of ads

#### 8\. [EmuBox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.emulator.box.aio)

With EmuBox, you can emulate multiple systems, such as Nintendo DS, PlayStation SNES, and more. Moreover, it is the first emulator to have multiple-platform support and a Material Design interface, which makes it look and feel superb.

There are advertisements on the emulator, but it is totally free to use. Although we do not currently know anything about a Pro version, there could be one. Compared to other 3DS emulators for Android, EmuBox has its pros and cons, which include bugs when too many cheat codes are used.

**Pros:**

* Provides multiple ROMs

It has many features, including allowing users to stretch out the screen, keeping the dimensions of it in line with the resolution of a game. Portraits and landscapes can be switched easily without any hassle.

**Price:** Free

The best Android 3DS emulator allows you to play any game that runs on the handheld Nintendo 3DS gaming console, such as Final Fantasy, Super Mario Bros., and Pokemon Sage. Its features are robust, with support for file formats such as .rar, .zip, .7z, and .nds, among others. Additionally, the emulator requires a large amount of RAM, as lower RAM would slow down the emulator.

**Pros:**

* Customizable screen sizes & orientation

**Cons:**
