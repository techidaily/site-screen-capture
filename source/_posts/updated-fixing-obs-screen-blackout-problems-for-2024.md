## Fixing OBS Screen Blackout Problems

OBS Studio is the most popular free video recording and streaming software. However, there are certain OBS issues that are often reported on different forums. OBS Studio not recording full screen is a common complaint. There are many who have reported that OBS is capturing Windowed screen but as soon as they are switching to Full screen recording, OBS fails miserably and captures only a black screen instead. There could be various reasons behind OBS full screen not working.

First of all, OBS Studio files could have got corrupted somehow. Sometimes, OBS Studio is heavily using CPU resources in capturing full screen, and hence, due to very fast access, CPU has limited the access of usage. There are could be a compatibility issue with OBS Studio and your Windows version. Sometimes, any third-party screen recording software could intervene in OBS operation. In this article, we will illustrate all the possible ways to fix OBS does not recording full screen issue.

## Way 1\. Modify CPU Setting for OBS

By default, OBS CPU usage present is set to very fast. This means the encoder is running very fast which leads to less CPU time usage. The higher the present, the less is the CPU usage. Unless you have a high-end computer, this default setting can lead to rendering and encoding issues. OBS uses more CPU resources when you are recording full screen. CPU tends to limit its allocation for OBS when OBS starts using CPU resources at a very fast speed. This leads to OBS not full screen recording issue. You should change the setting by taking the following steps.

Step 1: Open OBS Studio and go to Controls tab.

Step 2: Click on Settings button.

Step 3: Go to Output tab and change Output Mode from Simple to Advanced.

Step 4: Change CPU Usage Present from Veryfast to Ultrafast so that OBS uses less CPU resources for the encoding process.

Step 5: Click on Apply and Ok button.

## Way 2\. Shut Down The Game Bar Recording

There are certain gaming features available in Windows 10 that cause rendering issue for OBS studio. If game mode is on, all the GPU resources are used in the active game and hence, OBS suffers in performance. Similarly, if Game Bar recording is on, it interferes with OBS Studio full screen recording and leads to OBS studio not recording full screen game. You need to turn off Game Bar recording by taking the following steps.

Step 1: Go to Start menu and open Settings app.

Step 2: From Setting, open Gaming option.

Step 3: Go to Xbox Game Bar tab on the left side.

4: Turn it off so that it does not record your gameplay.

## Way 3\. Empower the Compatibility Mode

One of the common reasons why OBS does not recording full screen is due to compatibility issue with the operating system. That is why there is an option available in Windows to run any application in compatible mode with lower Windows version. You can do the same for OBS Studio and there are many users who have reported the issue of full screen recording getting solved when they changed the compatibility mode to Windows 8\. Here are the steps you have to take.

Step 1: Launch OBS Studio on your computer.

Step 2: Go to Start menu and open Task Manager.

Step 3: On Task manager, find OBS Studio under Apps. Right-click on it and select Properties.

Step 7: Click on Apply and OK button.

Relaunch OBS Studio and check if the problem is solved.

## Way 4\. Turn Your Gameplay to Windowed Mode

When OBS Studio not recording full screen game, you have to move to Windowed Mode momentarily to ensure OBS Studio is actually capturing the gameplay or not. After capturing your gameplay in Windowed mode, you can switch to Full Screen Mode and check if the problem is solved. This helps as the default settings get reset and any issue with the settings causing the problem gets resolved. Here are the steps to follow.

Step 1: Move your game from full screen mode to windowed mode. You need to check the Settings of your game and bring out the resolution and screen dimensions so that it moves to Windowed Mode from full screen settings.

Step 2: Open OBS Studio and from Sources, click on “+” icon and select Display Capture.

Step 3: Right-click on Display Capture and click on Windowed Projector option.

![turn your gameplay to windows mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/turn-your-gameplay-to-windows-mode.jpg)

Step 4: Click on Start Recording and move to your Windowed game screen. After recording for a few seconds, click on Stop Recording. Check if the recording has been successful.

Step 5: Thereafter, you can move your game to full screen mode. On OBS, you can then select Fullscreen Projector and select your monitor. Start recording again and see if OBS can capture the full screen now.

## Way 5\. Re-install OBS

Sometimes, the problem is with OBS Studio itself and not an external issue. There are times when OBS Studio may have crashed and in the process, certain important files of OBS Studio may have got corrupted. If the above solutions are not working to fix OBS not recording full screen issue, you have to uninstall and reinstall OBS Studio. In the process, you will be able to install the latest version of OBS Studio where minor glitches are fixed. Here are the steps to follow.

Step 1: Go to Control Panel > Programs and Features option.
