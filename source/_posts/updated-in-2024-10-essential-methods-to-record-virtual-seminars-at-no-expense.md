## 10 Essential Methods to Record Virtual Seminars at No Expense

In this world of digitization, webinars are the best online events for educating the masses and promoting products and services. If you have subscribed to any free or paid webinar, you should be ready to record the webinar so that you can go through the webinar at any future instance. Since webinars are live online events, you cannot watch them again if you do not record the webinars.

Recording a webinar is useful to understand any concept that you could not understand when it was getting broadcast. If you cannot be present all the time to attend the webinar, you can record the webinar and check it out later. In fact, you can share the recorded webinar with anyone at any time. If you want to record webinar free, we have lined up the best webinar recording software applications.

## Part 4\. Record Webinar on Android Phones

Unlike iPhone, most Android phones do not have a built-in screen recorder. That is why you have to install an external screen recorder app to record webinar for free. However, you have to be careful while choosing an external screen recorder because some of them could be spyware app. We recommend Mobizen screen recorder app which comes with all the required features and necessary security. The app does not save the recorded video on their servers but only on the user's device. There is no signing up required as you can record your screen instantly. Here are the steps on how to record webinar for free with Mobizen screen recorder.
