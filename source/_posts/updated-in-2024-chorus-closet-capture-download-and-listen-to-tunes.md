## Conclusion

Apple has now disabled the function of capturing internal and desktop sound in all its Mac. Moreover, even iShowU Audio Capture BigSur doesn’t work anymore. So what to do when you wish to record internal audio? The answer is iShowU Audio Capture, as it's a workaround that no one should miss. This software has been designed to record audio on your devices. It even holds several easy-to-set choices with a sturdy back-end that will help you customize the output, size, file, and resolution type. Thus, its outcome is a practical, robust audio recording tool ideal for tutorial videos and gaming.
