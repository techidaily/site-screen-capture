**Platforms:** PC, PS4 (Coming to Android, iOS, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch in the future)

### 5.PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds

![playerunknowns-battlegrounds-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/playerunknowns-battlegrounds-poster.png)

**Platforms:** PC, PlayStation 4 Xbox One, Android, and iOS

All Battle Royale games have an interesting origin story, but PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, or PUBG, has a particularly intriguing story. Before being licensed by Sony Online Entertainment for use in H1Z1, PUBG began as an Arma 2 and Arma 3 mod. Bluehole Studio hired Brendan Greene as a Creative Director of PUBG. This was when PUBG became PUBG.

A feature boasted by its biggest rival, PUBG lacks the capability of cross-platform play. Players can participate in 100-person sessions in PUBG, and play alone, with a friend, or with a squad of four. It's imperative that you land where you want after you drop from a plane to start the game, as you need to find armor, weapons, vehicles, and other items that'll keep you alive when you meet other players.

**Features:**

• Visually stunning and atmospheric.

• This is a novel concept for a battle royale.

• Growing community through active development.

• Matchmaking that happens quickly.

![spellbreak-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/spellbreak-poster.jpg)

**Platforms:** PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, PC

Battle Royale fans will enjoy Spellbreak. A multiplayer shooter allows dozens of players to battle it out on an ever-shrinking battlefield filled with weapons. Using a violent, magical aesthetic instead of a violent, military aesthetic, Spellbreak makes a great change.

The game is played using elemental spells in place of guns. You can combine these powers into devastating attacks by upgrading them to stronger versions. A cloud of poison gas can be set ablaze to create a satisfying effect. Players can move freely in Spellbreak, which turns skirmishes into heroic fights along with explosive combat. Want to retreat for a while? Simply release a bolt of lightning.

**Features:**

• Battle royale genre reimagined in an engaging, approachable way.

• A system for creating magic combats.

• The art style is very post-apocalyptic and fantasy-like.

• Profiles and cross-platform multiplayer are carried over.

### 8.SUPER ANIMAL ROYALE

![super-animal-royale-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/super-animal-royale-poster.png)

The game can be played on almost every platform. PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, macOS, PC, Google Stadia, and Nintendo Switch are all compatible with the game. Super Animal Royale supports cross-platform play as well.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![totally-accurate-battlegrounds-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/totally-accurate-battlegrounds-poster.png)

**Platforms:** PC

The next game takes a silly approach to the formula, and we're glad it exists. It's a comedic shooter parody that targets serious shooter franchises like PUBG (hence the name). There are up to 60 players in lobbies, so obviously, you've got to be the last team standing. When shot, players are ragdolled to oblivion, which adds to the humor.

It is an ambitious, chaotic work, with crude artwork, over-the-top weapons and items, and a wonderfully chaotic premise. A good first-person shooting game ties the whole thing together, so it's difficult to put it down. Its design ensures that the gameplay never feels like it is pushed to the background by the jokes, which speaks volumes about the game.

**Features:**

• Multiplayer action that is addicting.

• Introducing a novel concept of "battle royale".

• Support from a large community of developers.

• Each match is unique due to unpredictable variables.

### 10.Ring of Elysium

![ring-of-elysium-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ring-of-elysium-poster.jpg)

**Platforms:** PC

The Battle Royale game Kicking Things Off capitalizes on the popularity of the genre but comes with enough uniqueness to stand out. In addition to snowboards, hang gliders, and even grappling hooks for getting around the map, its main standout feature is how you move around it.

Each successive season of the game has had a different weather type, setting, and even volcanic ash to overcome for you. Season 1 was snow-themed, but other seasons have focused on storms and even nuclear power plants. During the final moments of a game, Ring of Elysium also features a rescue helicopter that allows up to four players to make it to the end - resulting in some tense moments. It's not perfect, but it's still a blast.

**Features:**

• World-building and graphics are beautiful.

• Play in a variety of ways.

• Battle Royale in a different light.

It is an ambitious, chaotic work, with crude artwork, over-the-top weapons and items, and a wonderfully chaotic premise. A good first-person shooting game ties the whole thing together, so it's difficult to put it down. Its design ensures that the gameplay never feels like it is pushed to the background by the jokes, which speaks volumes about the game.

**Features:**

• Multiplayer action that is addicting.

• Introducing a novel concept of "battle royale".

• Support from a large community of developers.

• Each match is unique due to unpredictable variables.

**Platforms:** PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, PC, Google Stadia

A great battle royale game that is free to play is Super Animal Royale. The game features abandoned safari park animals fighting each other with claws and guns instead of humanoid operators. The developers of Super Animal Royale have done an excellent job for an independent game.

The game can be played on almost every platform. PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, macOS, PC, Google Stadia, and Nintendo Switch are all compatible with the game. Super Animal Royale supports cross-platform play as well.

**Features:**

• The visuals are awesome.

• There is a lot of customization available.

• There are plenty of unique ideas.

### 9.Totally Accurate Battlegrounds

**Platforms:** PC

The next game takes a silly approach to the formula, and we're glad it exists. It's a comedic shooter parody that targets serious shooter franchises like PUBG (hence the name). There are up to 60 players in lobbies, so obviously, you've got to be the last team standing. When shot, players are ragdolled to oblivion, which adds to the humor.

It is an ambitious, chaotic work, with crude artwork, over-the-top weapons and items, and a wonderfully chaotic premise. A good first-person shooting game ties the whole thing together, so it's difficult to put it down. Its design ensures that the gameplay never feels like it is pushed to the background by the jokes, which speaks volumes about the game.

**Features:**

• Multiplayer action that is addicting.

• Introducing a novel concept of "battle royale".

• Support from a large community of developers.

• Each match is unique due to unpredictable variables.

### 10.Ring of Elysium

**Platforms:** PC

The Battle Royale game Kicking Things Off capitalizes on the popularity of the genre but comes with enough uniqueness to stand out. In addition to snowboards, hang gliders, and even grappling hooks for getting around the map, its main standout feature is how you move around it.

Each successive season of the game has had a different weather type, setting, and even volcanic ash to overcome for you. Season 1 was snow-themed, but other seasons have focused on storms and even nuclear power plants. During the final moments of a game, Ring of Elysium also features a rescue helicopter that allows up to four players to make it to the end - resulting in some tense moments. It's not perfect, but it's still a blast.

**Features:**

• World-building and graphics are beautiful.

• Play in a variety of ways.

• Battle Royale in a different light.
