After starting the Google Meet meeting or entering the password, you can see yourself on the screen. On the bottom right corner, there should appear a silhouette for Windows users.

Google Meet provides its users with three major fun and convenient options for blurred background Google Meet.

Online meetings have made our lives easier. We could be traveling and take a business call with the help of our iPhone or Android anywhere.

In addition, your Android smartphone should have 3 GB RAM, ARM64, 4 CPU cores, 1.6 GHz CPU clock. The majority of typical phones support all of the stated features. So, do not be concerned if you do not grasp all of the technical jargon. Just search the model of your mobile phone online and compare to find out.
