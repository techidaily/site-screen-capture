You can also set frame rates, and the quality of your video and start the recorder timer before starting recording. If you want to record the webcam footage or some other camera module attached to your PC too. All you need to check the Camera field and it will simultaneously record your camera feed too.

Soon as you start capturing your screen recording, you will a timer will start the countdown. Once it's finished, your recording will be started. After some time you think, it's time to finish recording then you don’t have to worry about that too. All you have to do is by clicking the small icon in the top-right icon bar of the desktop screen of your MacBook Air as shown in the picture below attached.
