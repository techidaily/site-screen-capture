## Part 1: How to Set up OBS Stream Settings

OBS Studio provides several wonderful tools for beginner broadcasters who are just getting the swing of live broadcasting. The program contains a set of OBS-specific system requirements to guarantee the most optimum live broadcasting experience. These options include the ability to mix several sources with unique transitions, employ audio/video filters and correction tools, and more. First, access the OBS Studio settings by selecting the “Settings” button in the bottom-right region of the program window. The first tab, named “General,” doesn’t include anything particularly significant to examine. However, here, you may pick your language and choose a bright or dark theme.

### Steps to Set up OBS Stream Settings

****Step 1:** Once you’ve evaluated these options, click on the next tab labeled “Stream” in the OBS Studio settings box. Game capture is suggested for live streaming since it is designed for recording screen material as well as capturing video.

## Part 1: How to Set up OBS Stream Settings

OBS Studio provides several wonderful tools for beginner broadcasters who are just getting the swing of live broadcasting. The program contains a set of OBS-specific system requirements to guarantee the most optimum live broadcasting experience. These options include the ability to mix several sources with unique transitions, employ audio/video filters and correction tools, and more. First, access the OBS Studio settings by selecting the “Settings” button in the bottom-right region of the program window. The first tab, named “General,” doesn’t include anything particularly significant to examine. However, here, you may pick your language and choose a bright or dark theme.

### Steps to Set up OBS Stream Settings

****Step 1:** Once you’ve evaluated these options, click on the next tab labeled “Stream” in the OBS Studio settings box. Game capture is suggested for live streaming since it is designed for recording screen material as well as capturing video. Multiple sources may be utilized as scenes, and they can be made visible or invisible with the touch of a button.

****Step 2:** As soon as you run OBS, you are greeted with the auto-config window, which automatically picks various choices for you based on how you want to use it. The auto-configuration settings may be toggled again by clicking on Tools -> Auto-Configuration Wizard. However, your connection speed may be too slow to handle this bitrate. You may simply confirm whether this is the case by running a speed test.

****Step 3:** On the top, we have the primary canvas showcasing all material to be captured or broadcast. We may add as many sources as we need. There are several choices for visual sources as well as audio channels. By default, the resolution is the same as the laptop screen. At the bottom, various sceneries may be specified. Scenes comprise multiple sources that may be utilized to capture or broadcast.
