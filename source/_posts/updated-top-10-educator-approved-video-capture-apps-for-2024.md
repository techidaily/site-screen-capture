Being a teacher it's a challenging task to deliver lectures to the students without recording them for future use by the students.

But you don't have to worry anymore because we have done a lot of research to suggest some good screen recorders that are perfect for teachers. So all you have to do is go grab some coffee and start reading this article to see some best-recommended screen recording software for your lecture recording.

## Part 1: Why do teachers use a screen recorder?

The most common use of screen recorder by teachers is due to its use for recording their lectures, and presentations so it can be later on be used by the students. Moreover, nowadays all the lectures are delivered online from classrooms such as zoom, google classroom but the problem with these platforms is that theydon'tt record the provided lectures.

Another thing is that most of the teachers want to have perfect applications to record their screen records to edit whereas many screen records are available which can even record and lively draw, write and edit that recording. So these are some of the most common uses of screen recorders by teachers.

## Part 2: What features a screen recorder for teaching should have?

Before the teacher opts for a certain screen recorder to use he must know some of the basic points to consider in screen recorder. In this section, we will discuss those screen recorders.

Easy-to-use: The first and foremost thing that teachers should consider about a screen recorder application is its interface complexity. In other words, the screen recorder that he will use should be user-friendly. Since most of the teachers don't have a software background therefore user-friendly applications are recommended for them.

Cursor effects: Other important features that a screen recorder should have are cursor effects. Since teachers usually provide lectures and need to point out many things on the screen and write different stuff to guide their students therefore it is always best to use a screen recorder having cursor effects.

Annotation tools: We know that during delivering lectures the teacher must need tools that can draw, write and comment on a particular section on the screen. Since teachers always provide information this way they must use screen recorders that are equipped with different annotation tools.

Webcam recording: Since most of the teachers provide lectures online therefore they also need to record them through screen recorders. However, while providing lectures it's important that during recording the webcam of the teacher should also be recorded to be seen on the providing lectures. This ensures full communication between the students and teachers.

Customizable recording area: Many recorders cannot record a certain area on the screen therefore for teachers it should be avoided in the first place. While recording lectures it's always necessary for teachers to record a certain area on the screen and leave the rest so screen recorders that have customizable recording areas are strongly recommended to teachers.

Great video quality: Last and the important factor that should be considered in screen recorders required for teachers is the quality of the recording. Since delivering lectures about important matters the video must contain the small details in perfect quality to avoid confusion when it is watched later. So for teachers, it is important to choose a recorder that records in the finest quality.
