 If you are looking for excellent online conferencing tools, then we advise you to check out FreeConference. Their whiteboard feature allows collaboration from all participants. The software takes an MP3 recording and sends it to you to make minutes easier… they even give you transcriptions and access to an online catalog for past meetings.

**Features**:

* Mobile compatible – probably the most thorough set of tools for Smartphone meetings.
* The whiteboard tool is entirely immersive, but we love that transcription/annotation service and the back catalog of meeting data.
* Free conference calls are unlimited and host up to 400 people.

### 5\. [JoinMe](https://www.join.me/)

![JoinMe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/join-me.JPG)

You set up a meeting and invite others to join you, whether you are at your desk or on the move. This is a toll-free service that promises no concealed or hidden costs. We would advise those looking for a great meeting with their friends to use this service.

**Features**:

* Free screen sharing conference tool that lets you transfer files and even share control.
* Schedule meetings – but with either your Google or your Outlook calendar, depending on the system you use.
* Customization and meeting tools such as annotation are included.
