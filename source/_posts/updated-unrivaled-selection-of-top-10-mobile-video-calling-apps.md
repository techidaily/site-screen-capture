* Aimed at the very young, we’re not even sure this demographic should have iPhones yet

### 10\. [WeChat](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wechat/id414478124)

WeChat is also aimed at the younger generations, but it is more Gen Z and less under-the-age-of-ten.

![WeChat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wechat-app.JPG)

Features:

* Custom sticker making, a gallery and a time capsule feature from your memories
* Direction sharing for easy meetups, mini-programs, and top stories
* Everything that Facebook has, but marketed at a younger age group

Pros:

* It’s fresh and cool
* They incorporate a healing kit and health tracking data app
* You can keep track of your teenagers with it, low key

Cons:

* Most definitely not the best business video call chat for iPhone.
