## Veiled Vocal Keepers: IOS & Android Secretive Sound Tools

In today’s world, you cannot prove anything to anyone unless you have concrete evidence.

The world has moved on from a secret voice recording device to a secret voice recording app. This is because we have our smartphones with us all the time.
